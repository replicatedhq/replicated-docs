### Bug Fixes {#bug-fixes-main}
* Fixes an issue that caused inadvertent application upgrades while redeploying or updating the config of the currently installed release in [Helm managed mode (Alpha)](/vendor/helm-install).
* Fixes an issue that caused namespace to be omitted from the `helm upgrade` command in [Helm managed mode (Alpha)](/vendor/helm-install).
* Removed unsupported options from the ["Configure automatic updates"](/enterprise/updating-apps#configure-automatic-updates) dialog because it's not supported in [Helm managed mode (Alpha)](/vendor/helm-install).
* Fixes an issue where updating the registry settings fails due to permission issues even when the provided credentials do have access to the registry.
* Fixed an issue that could cause templates to be shown on the [config page](/vendor/config-screen-about#admin-console-config-tab) instead of actual rendered values in [Helm managed mode (Alpha)](/vendor/helm-install).
