# Replicated Documentation Style Guide

## Overview

This set of rules provides guidelines for writing clear and consistent product documentation for the Replicated Platform.

## General Principles

### Tone and Voice
- Use active voice instead of passive voice
- Use the second person "you" to address the reader
- Never use "we" or "let's"
- Write in a friendly tone without using slang, jargon, or frivolous words.

### Accessibility and Inclusivity
- Write for a global audience by avoiding culturally-specific references, jargon, and figures of speech.
- In HTML, use semantic tagging.
- Avoid unnecessary font formatting.
- Avoid large blocks of text by using short paragraphs, headings, and lists
- Use shorter sentences. Try to use fewer than 26 words per sentence.

### Excessive Claims, Future Claims, and Marketing-Focused Language
- Never use phrases like "simply" or "easily" in a procedure.
- Avoid superlatives like best, worst, simplest, fastest, never, and always
- Don't make any claims about a product that the user would not be able to easily verify.

### Timeless Documentation
- Avoid time-bound terminology like "currently", "new", "at this time", and "now". Instead, write timeless documentation that makes no assumptions about a reader's prior knowledge.

## Formatting

### Text Formatting
- Use bold for UI elements
- Use bold for navigation steps in a UI, such as **Releases > Create Release**.
- Use italics to draw attention to a word or phrase, such as when defining the term for the first time

### Capitalization
- Use title case for titles and headings
- Use all caps with underscores between words for placeholder text
- Avoid all caps outside of placeholder text and code examples

### Symbols
- Avoid using the ampersand symbol (&) except when describing UI elements, writing code examples, or in tables where space is limited

### Punctuation
- Avoid semicolons
- Avoid exclamation marks
- Avoid question marks

## Linking

### Cross-references
- A good cross-reference describes what information the reader can expect to learn, as well as the exact title (and location) of the page they will be taken to.
- Do not embed links within a sentence.
- Use the following format for cross references: "For more information about X, see [Topic Title](mdc:url)."
- For links to other websites outside of docs.replicated.com, use the following format: "For more information about X, see [Topic Title](mdc:url) in the Company Name documentation."
