# About the Replicated SDK

This topic provides an introduction to using the Replicated SDK with your application.

## Overview

<SDKOverview/>

For more information about the Replicated SDK API, see [Replicated SDK API](/reference/replicated-sdk-apis).
 
## SDK Resiliency

At startup and when serving requests, the SDK retrieves and caches the latest information from the upstream Replicated APIs, including customer license information.

If the upstream APIs are not available at startup, the SDK does not accept connections or serve requests until it is able to communicate with the upstream APIs. If communication fails, the SDK retries every 10 seconds and the SDK pod is at `0/1` ready.

When serving requests, if the upstream APIs become unavailable, the SDK serves from the memory cache and sets the `X-Replicated-Served-From-Cache` header to `true`.  Additionally, rapid successive requests to same SDK endpoint with the same request properties will be rate-limited returning the last cached payload and status code without reaching out to the upstream APIs. A `X-Replicated-Rate-Limited` header will set to `true`.

## Replicated SDK Helm Values

:::note
The Replicated SDK `replicated` values are different from the `global.replicated` values that are injected by the Replicated registry during Helm CLI installations. The `global.replicated` values are injected regardless of if the Replicated SDK is distributed alongside the application as dependency. For more information about the `global.replicated` values, see [Helm global.replicated Values Schema](/vendor/helm-install-values-schema).
