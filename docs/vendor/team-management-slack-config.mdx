# Configure a Slack Webhook (Classic)

:::caution Classic System
This Slack webhook configuration is part of the classic Instance Notifications system, which is being replaced by [Event Notifications (Beta)](event-notifications). The new Event Notifications system supports direct webhook delivery to Slack (and other services) without requiring team-level Slack configuration.

For new integrations, we recommend using [Event Notification Webhooks (Beta)](event-notifications-webhooks) instead.
:::

As a vendor, anyone on your team can set up Slack notifications, which are sent to a shared Slack channel. Notifications give your team visibility into customer instance statuses and changes.

<NotificationsAbout/>

While email notifications are specific to each user, Slack notifications settings are shared, viewable, and editable by the entire team. Any changes made by a team member impacts the team.

## Limitations

The following limitations apply to classic Slack webhook configuration:

- Only one Slack channel per team is supported.

- RBAC policies are not supported for configuring granular permissions.

## Prerequisite

Create a Slack webhook URL. For more information, see [Sending Messages using Incoming Webhooks](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) in the Slack API documentation.

Make sure to keep the URL secure because it contains a Secret that allows write access to one or more channels in your Slack Workspace.

## Configure the Webhook in the Vendor Portal

When you enable Slack notifications for a team, you must first configure the Slack webhook in the Vendor Portal. Typically you do this one time. Then you can configure notifications for individual customer instances.

To configure the Slack webhook:

1. From the **[Team Vendor Portal](https://vendor.replicated.com/team/members)** page, click **Slack Notifications**.

1. On the **Slack Notifications Setup** page, paste the Slack webhook URL. Click **Save**.

## Next Steps

**For classic Instance Notifications:**
- [Configure Instance Notifications (Classic)](instance-notifications-config) - Configure Slack notifications for customer instances

**For new Event Notifications:**
- [Event Notification Webhooks (Beta)](event-notifications-webhooks) - Send notifications directly to Slack using webhooks (no team-level configuration required)
- [Create Event Notification Subscriptions (Beta)](event-notifications-create) - Set up notification subscriptions with the new system
