# Step 3: Package the Helm Chart

Next, add the Replicated SDK as a dependency of the Helm chart and then package the chart into a `.tgz` archive. The purpose of this step is to prepare the Helm chart to be added to a release.

To add the Replicated SDK and package the Helm chart:

1. In your local file system, go to the `grafana` directory that was created as part of [Step 1: Get the Sample Chart and Test](tutorial-config-get-chart).

1. In the `Chart.yaml` file, add the Replicated SDK as a dependency:

   <DependencyYaml/>

1. Update dependencies and package the Helm chart to a `.tgz` chart archive:

   ```bash
   helm package . --dependency-update
   ```
   <UnauthorizedError/>

## Next Step

Create a release using the Helm chart archive. See [Step 4: Add the Chart Archive to a Release](tutorial-config-create-release).
