### Sign Up for a Self-Service Account

If self-service sign-ups are enabled for the application, users can create an account in the Enterprise Portal without being invited. The primary use case for self-service account creation is to sign up for a trial or community version of the software.

:::note
For information about how to enable self-service sign-ups from the Vendor Portal, see [Enable Self-Service Sign-Ups](/vendor/enterprise-portal-self-serve-signup).
:::

To sign up for a self-service account and log in to the Enteprise Portal:

1. Go to the sign-up page URL.

    :::note
    For information about how to find the unique sign-up URL in the Vendor Portal, see [Share Your Sign-Up URL](/vendor/enterprise-portal-self-serve-signup#share-trial-url) in _Enable Self-Service Sign-Ups_.
    :::

1. Enter your company name and email address, agree to the terms and conditions, and click **Create account**.

    The following shows an example of a self-service sign-up page for an application:

### About SAML Logins (Alpha) {#about-saml}

:::note
SAML Authentication to the Enterprise Portal is Alpha and subject to change. To access this feature, a feature flag must be enabled for your team. For more information, reach out to your Replicated account representative.
:::

When SAML authentication is enabled and configured for your Enterprise Portal team, you can log in with your single sign-on (SSO) credentials either through your SAML Identity Provider (IdP) or the Enterprise Portal. For more information about how to configure SAML, see [Configure SAML Authentication (Alpha)](#saml) below.

#### Just-In-Time User Provisioning

The first time that you attempt to log in with SAML using your SSO credentials, if you do not already have an Enterprise Portal account, then your account is automatically created using just-in-time (JIT) user provisioning. JIT is handled differently depending on if you attempt to log in through your IdP or the Enterprise Portal:
* IdP-initiated SAML login attempts always allow for JIT user provisioning
* Enterprise Portal-initiated SAML login attempts allow for JIT user provisioning if your email address has already been invited to the team. See [Invite or Delete Users](#invite-or-delete-users) below.

## View Install and Update Instructions

This section describes how to view install and update instructions in the Enterprise Portal.

The install and update instructions available in the Enterprise Portal are automatically generated based on the install types and options enabled in the customer's license.

    If you exit the Enterprise Portal before completing the installation, you can resume the installation process by clicking **Continue installation** on the **Install** page, as shown below:
