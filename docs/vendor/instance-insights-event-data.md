# About Instance and Event Data

This topic describes the application instance data fields that the Replicated vendor portal uses to generate events for the instance.

## How the Vendor Portal Collects Instance Data {#about-reporting}

For application instances installed in online customer environments, the Replicated app manager periodically sends a small amount of instance data to the vendor portal, including properties such as the current version and status of the instance.

The app manager sends this instance data to the vendor portal when any of the following _check-ins_ occur:

<Checkins/>

The primary purpose of this instance data is to help the cloud-hosted update service to compile the list of new versions that are available to the given instance for upgrade. The vendor portal also uses this instance data to display insights about the active instances of your application.

For a full overview of what data might be included, see the [Replicated Data Transmission Policy](https://docs.replicated.com/vendor/policies-data-transmission).
## How the Vendor Portal Generates Events

When the vendor portal receives instance data from the app manager, it evaluates each data field to determine if there was a change in its value. For each field that changes in value, the vendor portal creates an _event_ to record the change. For example, a change from `ready` to `degraded` in the `appStatus` data field generates an event in the vendor portal.

In addition to creating events for changes in data fields sent by the app manager, the vendor portal also generates events for changes in the value of a computed metric. For example, the vendor portal computes a `numberVersionsBehind` metric that tracks the number of versions behind the latest available version for the instance. When the instance checks for updates and the vendor portal identifies a new version that is available to the instance, then the vendor portal generates an event to indicate the change in the value of the `numberVersionsBehind` metric. The vendor portal updates the values of computed metrics each time the app manager sends instance data.

Each event that the vendor portal generates for application instances has the following fields:

* `fieldName`: The instance data field that generated the event. For example, `appStatus`. 
* `previousValue`: The value of the data field before the vendor portal generated the event.
* `newValue`: The value of the data field after the vendor portal generated the event.

The vendor portal uses events to display insights for each active application instance in a **Instance details** dashboard. 
For more information about using the vendor portal **Instance details** page to monitor active instances of your application, see [Viewing Instance Details](instance-insights-details).

## Limitations

The vendor portal has the following limitations for reporting instance data and generating events:

* **Status informers required**: You must configure one or more status informers for your application in the Application custom resource to populate instance data about the application status or uptime. For more information about how to configure status informers, see [Displaying Application Status](admin-console-display-app-status).
* **Air gap not supported**: Instance data is available only for application instances installed in online environments. Data for instances installed in air gapped environments is not available.
* **Active instances only**: Instance data is available only for active application instances. An instance is considered inactive when its most recent check-in was more than two weeks ago. An instance can become inactive if it is decommissioned, stops checking for updates, or otherwise stops reporting.

   The vendor portal continues to display data for an inactive instance from its most-recently seen state. This means that data for an inactive instance might continue to show a Ready status after the instance becomes inactive. Replicated recommends that you use the timestamp in the **Last Check-in** field to understand if an instance might have become inactive, causing its data to be out-of-date.
* **Instance data freshness**: The rate at which data is updated in the vendor portal varies depends on how often the vendor portal receives instance data from the app manager. The vendor portal receives instance data when any of the following occur:
  <Checkins/>
* **Event timestamps**: The timestamp of events displayed on the **Instances details** page is the timestamp when the Replicated Vendor API received the instance data from the app manager. The timestamp of events does not necessarily reflect the timestamp of when the event occurred.
* **Caching for Kubernetes installer cluster data**: For clusters created with the Replicated Kubernetes installer, the app manager stores the counts of total nodes and ready nodes in a cache for five minutes. If the app manager sends instance data to the vendor portal within the five minute window, then the reported data for total nodes and ready nodes reflects the data in the cache. This means that events displayed on the **Instances details** page for the total nodes and ready nodes can show values that differ from the current values of these fields.  
## Types of Events

This section describes each type of event that the vendor portal generates for active application instances. Events in the vendor portal are grouped into the following categories:

* [Application Installation and Upgrade Events](#install-upgrade)
* [Cluster Status Events](#cluster)
* [Infrastructure Status Events](#infrastructure)
* [KOTS Status Events](#kots)
* [Upstream Update Events](#upstream)

The tables in this section include the following details about each event type:

* **Field Name**: The `fieldName` associated with the event.
* **Description**: A description of the data field.
* **Type**: The data type of the field. Possible values are string, number, and boolean.
* **Label**: The label for the event that displays in the **Instance Activity** stream in the vendor portal **Instance Details** page. For more information, see [Instance Activity](instance-insights-details#instance-activity) in _Viewing Instance Details_.
