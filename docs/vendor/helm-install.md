# Supporting helm CLI Installations (Beta)

:::note
Allowing users to install with the helm CLI is an Beta feature. To enable this feature on your account, log in to your vendor portal account. Select **Support** > **Request a feature**, and submit a feature request for "Helm CLI install option".
:::

Some enterprise users prefer or require a Helm chart to install using the `helm` CLI. This is often because Helm is already approved and the customer has a custom CI pipeline that is compatible with Helm charts. Replicated has introduced Beta support to enable these users to use Helm to install your application.

## Prerequisites

To support installations with the helm CLI, you must:
  * Have an application that contains one or more Helm charts. For information about how to create a release using an existing Helm chart, see [Adding Helm Charts to a Release](helm-release).
  * If your application uses private images, update your Helm chart to deliver the required image pull secret and to reference the Replicated proxy service. For more information, see [Using Private Registries for helm CLI Installations (Beta)](helm-image-registry).

## About Supporting helm CLI installations {#about}

Using Helm charts to create a release in the vendor portal allows you to package your application one time and support the following application installation methods:

* **KOTS Install**: Install on an existing cluster using the kots CLI or the admin console UI
* **Embedded Cluster**: Install on a cluster provisioned by the Replicated Kubernetes installer
* **Helm Install**: Install on an existing cluster using the helm CLI

To support each of these installations methods from a single release, you use the `values` field of the Replicated HelmChart custom resource. The `values` field supports both templated values that are generated by Replicated template functions, as well as static, or _hardcoded_, values.

Replicated injects any templated values from the HelmChart custom resource `values` field into the Helm chart `values.yaml` file. For example, you can use template functions in the HelmChart custom resource to map user-specific values such as license fields or configuration values to the `values.yaml` file.

For Helm Install installations, Replicated does _not_ inject any static values from the HelmChart custom resource `values` field into the Helm chart `values.yaml` file. Any static values in the `values` field affect only KOTS Install and Embedded Cluster installations, and are ignored for Helm Install installations.

This means that you can include static values in the `values` field when it is required to make a change in the release that affects only KOTS Install and Embedded Cluster installations. For example, you might need to deliver a Helm chart dependency with your application for only helm CLI installations. You can use static values in the HelmChart custom resource `values` field to ensure that the dependency is excluded from the release for KOTS Install and Embedded Cluster installations.

For examples of how to use templated and static values in the HelmChart custom resource `values` field to support all installation methods, see the following procedures:
* [Delivering the Admin Console with your Application](#deliver-admin-console)
* [Using Private Registries](#private-images)

## About Installing with the helm CLI

### Overview

When you promote an application to a release channel, Replicated extracts any Helm charts included in the release. These charts are pushed as OCI objects to the Replicated private registry at `registry.replicated.com`. The Helm chart is pushed to the _channel_.

For example, if your app is named "app", you create a channel named "nightly", and the release promoted contains a Helm chart with `name: my-chart` in the `Chart.yaml`, then the chart is pushed to `oci://registry.replicated.com/app/nightly/my-chart`. The chart version (tag) is read from the `Chart.yaml`.

This feature supports multiple charts. If your application release contains more than a single chart, all charts are uploaded to the registry.

When a new version of a chart is uploaded, Replicated renders and cache that version for each license when it is pulled the first time.

When a license field changes for a customer, Replicated invalidates all rendered and cached charts. This causes the charts to be rebuilt the next time they are pulled.

The `values.yaml` in your Chart is rendered with a customer-specific license. Each customer logs in with unique credentials, and our registry is able to identify which customer is pulling the chart. This creates a way to pass custom license fields and other customer-specific data into the `values.yaml` as defaults, and consume them in Helm templates.

Before Replicated renders the `values.yaml`, it is not assumed to be a valid YAML format in order to allow flow control and conditional template functions to optionally write some fields to the `values.yaml` file. Replicated renders template functions in the `values.yaml` for each customer, as the Helm chart is served to the customer.

### Chart Versioning

The chart version is used as the image tag in the OCI registry and must comply with image tag format requirements. A valid tag can contain only lowercase and uppercase letters, digits, underscores, periods, and dashes.

The chart version must also comply with the Semantic Versioning (SemVer) specification. When you run the `helm install` command without the `--version` flag, Helm retrieves the list of all available image tags for the chart from the registry and compares them using the SemVer comparison rules described in the SemVer specification. The version that is installed is the version with the largest tag value. For more information about the SemVer specification, see the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) documentation.

## Limitations

The `helm install` method is Beta and has the following limitations:

* No support for "last mile" changes with Kustomize. All configuration and customization must be done using Helm.
* No support for `strict` preflights that block application installation. This is because Helm does not automatically run preflight checks. Preflight checks are supported with `helm install`, but your users must run the preflight checks manually before installing your application.
* No support for air gap installations. Replicated has documented a workaround solution for installing into air gap environments.
* Customer adoption is not reported to the vendor portal.
* This feature supports multiple charts and Replicated does not wrap or provide any special tooling to manage multiple charts. Replicated recommends that you provide installation instructions with sequenced steps for users to follow to install each chart in the required order.
* The Replicated admin console is not included by default when your users install using the helm CLI. For more information, see [Delivering the Admin Console with your Application](#deliver-admin-console) below.

## Delivering the Admin Console with your Application {#deliver-admin-console}

By default, when your users install your application using the helm CLI, the admin console is not included. This section describes how to deliver the admin console alongside your application.

### Overview of Delivering the Admin Console

To deliver the admin console with your application for Helm Install installations, include the `admin-console` Helm chart in the `dependencies` field of your `Chart.yaml` file.

When you include the `admin-console` Helm chart as a dependency, Replicated injects values into the Helm chart `values.yaml` file when the chart is pulled by your users. These values provide the license ID for the customer, which enables the admin console to authenticate with the image registry and check for updates.

The following shows the formatting of the `replicated` and `license_id` fields that Replicated adds to the `values.yaml` file:

```
replicated:
  license_id: abcdef123
```

The functionality of the admin console delivered by the `admin-console` Helm chart differs from that of the admin console available for KOTS Install or Embedded Cluster installations.

This is because Helm, rather than the admin console, manages the lifecycle of the application when users install with the helm CLI. For example, instead of including an Upgrade button, the admin console delivered by the `admin-console` Helm chart provides the correct `helm upgrade` commands for users.

### Add the admin-console Chart

This procedure shows how to add the `admin-console` Helm chart as a conditional dependency of your Helm chart.

It also shows how to exclude the `admin-console` Helm chart when your users install with either the KOTS Install or Embedded Cluster installation methods. It is important to exclude the `admin-console` chart in this scenario because both the kots CLI and the Kubernetes installer already install the admin console by default.

To conditionally include and exclude the `admin-console` Helm chart:

1.  In the Helm chart `Chart.yaml` file, add the `admin-console` Helm chart to the `dependencies` field:

   ```yaml
    dependencies:
    - name: admin-console
      version: "1.83.0"
      repository: "oci://registry.replicated.com/library"
      condition: admin-console.enabled
   ```

   The following table describes the fields:
   <table>
     <tr>
       <th>Field</th>
       <th>Description</th>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td><code>name</code></td>
       <td>The name of the <code>admin-console</code> Helm chart.</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td><code>version</code></td>
       <td>The version of the admin console to deliver with your application. Replicated recommends that you use the latest version. For more information about the available versions, see the <a href="/release-notes/rn-app-manager">App Manager Release Notes</a>.</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td><code>repository</code></td>
       <td>The URL for the Replicated private image registry where the <code>admin-console</code> Helm chart is accessed.</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td><code>condition</code></td>
       <td><p>A conditional statement that defines when the <code>admin-console</code> chart is included.</p>
       <p>In the next step of this procedure, you create an <code>admin-console</code> field in the <code>values.yaml</code> file of your Helm chart that maps to this conditional statement.</p></td>
     </tr>
   </table>

1. In the `values.yaml` file, add the following fields that map to the `condition` field in the `Chart.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   admin-console:
    enabled: true
   ```

   Helm Install installations read this `true` value from the `values.yaml` file and include the `admin-console` Helm chart in the deployment.

1. Package your Helm chart, and add the packaged chart to a release in the Replicated vendor portal. For more information, see [Add a Helm Chart to a Release](helm-release#add-a-helm-chart-to-a-release).

1. In the release, create or open the HelmChart custom resource manifest file. A HelmChart custom resource manifest file has `kind: HelmChart` and `apiVersion: kots.io/v1beta1`. For more information, see [HelmChart](/reference/custom-resource-helmchart) in the _References_ section.

   **Template:**

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: kots.io/v1beta1
   kind: HelmChart
   metadata:
     name: samplechart
   spec:
     ...
   ```

1. Edit the HelmChart manifest file to exclude the `admin-console` Helm chart during KOTS Install and Embedded Cluster installations:

   1. Add the following to the `values` field:

      ```yaml
      values:
        admin-console:
         enabled: false
      ```

      KOTS Install and Embedded Cluster installations read this static value of `false` from the HelmChart custom resource, which prevents the `admin-console` Helm chart from deploying. Helm Install installations ignore this static value, and instead read the value of `true` from the `values.yaml` file that you added in a previous step.

      **Example:**

      ```yaml
      apiVersion: kots.io/v1beta1
      kind: HelmChart
      metadata:
        name: samplechart
      spec:
        chart:
          name: samplechart
          chartVersion: 3.1.7
          releaseName: samplechart-release-v1
        values:
          admin-console:
           enabled: false  
      ```     

   1. If the HelmChart custom resource includes an `optionalValues` field, set `recursiveMerge` to `true`. This prevents the `admin-console` field in `values` from being overwritten by the fields in `optionalValues`.

      **Example:**

      ```yaml
      optionalValues:
       - when: "repl{{ ConfigOptionEquals `example_config_option`}}"
         recursiveMerge: true
         values:
           example_key: example_value
      ```     

      For more information, see [recursiveMerge](/reference/custom-resource-helmchart#optionalvaluesrecursivemerge) in _HelmChart_.

   1. Add the following to the `builder` field:

      ```yaml
      builder:
        admin-console:
          enabled: false
      ```

      Values in the `builder` field provide a way to render the chart with all images and manifests. A common use case for the `builder` field in Replicated is to create packages for delivering an application to an air gap environment.

      For more information, see [builder](/reference/custom-resource-helmchart#builder) in _HelmChart_.

      **Example:**

      ```yaml
      apiVersion: kots.io/v1beta1
      kind: HelmChart
      metadata:
        name: samplechart
      spec:
        chart:
          name: samplechart
          chartVersion: 3.1.7
          releaseName: samplechart-release-v1
        values:
          admin-console:
           enabled: false
        builder:
          admin-console:
           enabled: false              
      ```
  1. Save and promote the release to a development environment to test your changes.       

## Example: Delivering Custom License Fields

`values.yaml`

```
numSeats: repl{{ LicenseFieldValue "num_seats"}}
```

`templates/deployment.yaml`

```
        ...
        env:
          - name: NUM_SEATS
            value: {{ .Values.numSeats }}
```
