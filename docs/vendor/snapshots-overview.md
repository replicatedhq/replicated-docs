# About Backup and Restore

Replicated's backup and restore feature for applications is called snapshots. You can optionally enable snapshots to support backup and restore for your users.

Snapshots use the Velero open source project as the backend to back up Kubernetes manifests and persistent volumes. Velero is a mature, fully-featured application. For more information, see the [Velero documentation](https://velero.io/docs/).

In addition to the default functionality that Velero provides, the Replicated admin console provides a detailed interface where your users can manage storage destinations, schedule snapshots, and perform and monitor the backup process. For more information, see [About Backup and Restore]((/enterprise/snapshots-understanding) in the _Enterprise_ documentation.

These details can also be managed using the kots CLI, the CLI for the app manager.

:::note
The restore process is managed through the kots CLI only.

The app manager also exposes hooks that can be used to inject scripts to execute with snapshots both [before and after a backup](snapshots-configuring-backups) and [before and after a restore](../enterprise/snapshots-understanding).

## How to Enable Backup and Restore

To enable the snapshots backup and restore feature for your users, you must:

- Have the snapshots entitlement enabled in your Replicated vendor account. For account entitlements, contact the Replicated TAM team.
- Define a manifest for executing snapshots and restoring previous snapshots. For more information, see [Configuring Backups](snapshots-configuring-backups).
- Enable the Allow Snapshot option in customer licenses. For more information, see [Creating a Customer](releases-creating-customer).

Additionally, your end users must install Velero to access the snapshot functionality in the Replicated admin console. For more information about the enterprise snapshots procedures, see [Understanding Snapshots](../enterprise/snapshots-understanding) in the _Enterprise_ documentation.

## Velero Version Compatibility

The following table lists which versions of Velero are compatible with each version of the app manager.

:::note
The app manager is based on the open source KOTS project, which is maintained by Replicated.
