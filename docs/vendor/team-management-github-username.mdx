# Managing Collab Repository Access

This topic describes how to add users to the Replicated collab GitHub repository automatically through the vendor portal. It also includes information about managing user roles in this repository using vendor portal role-based access control (RBAC) policies.

## Overview of Managing Collab Access {#overview}

<CollabRepoAbout/>

To get access to the collab repository, members of a vendor portal team can add their GitHub username to the [Account Settings](https://vendor.replicated.com/account-settings) page in the vendor portal. The vendor portal then automatically provisions the team member as a user in the collab repository in GitHub. The RBAC policy that the member is assigned in the vendor portal determines the GitHub role that they have in the collab repository.

Replicated recommends that vendor portal admins manage user access to the collab repository through the vendor portal, rather than manually managing users through GitHub. Managing access through the vendor portal has the following benefits:
* Users are automatically added to the collab repository when they add their GitHub username in the vendor portal.
* Users are automatically removed from the collab repository when they are removed from the vendor portal team.
* Vendor portal and collab repository RBAC policies are managed from a single location.

For more information about adding users to the collab repository through the vendor portal, see [Add Users to the Collab Repository](#add) below.

### Default GitHub Roles {#default}

When team members add a GitHub username to their vendor portal account, the vendor portal determines how to assign the user a GitHub role in the collab repository based on the following criteria:
* If the GitHub username already exists in the collab repository
* The policy assigned to the member in the vendor portal

For more information about how the vendor portal handles existing GitHub usernames, see [Default GitHub Roles for Existing Users](#existing-username) below.

For more information about how the policy assigned to the member in the vendor portal maps to a GitHub role in the collab repository, see [Default GitHub Role Mapping](#role-mapping) below.

#### Default GitHub Roles for Existing Users {#existing-username}

<CollabExistingUser/>

#### Default GitHub Role Mapping {#role-mapping}

When team members add a GitHub username to their vendor portal account, the vendor portal assigns them to a GitHub role in the collab repository that corresponds to their vendor portal policy. For example, users with the default Read Only policy in the vendor portal are assigned the Read GitHub role in the collab repository.

For team members assigned custom RBAC policies in the vendor portal, you can edit the custom policy to change their GitHub role in the collab repository. For more information, see [About Changing the Default GitHub Role](#custom) below.

The table below describes how each default and custom vendor portal policy corresponds to a role in the collab repository in GitHub. For more information about each of the GitHub roles described in this table, see [Permissions for each role](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/repository-roles-for-an-organization#permissions-for-each-role) in the GitHub documentation.

### About Changing the Default GitHub Role {#custom}

You can update any custom RBAC policies that you create in the vendor portal to change the default GitHub roles for those policies. For example, by default, any team members assigned a custom policy with `**/admin` under `allowed:` are assigned the Admin role in the collab repository in GitHub. You can update the custom policy to specify a more restrictive GitHub role.

To edit a custom policy to change the default GitHub role assigned to users with that policy, add one of the following RBAC resources to the `allowed:` or `denied:` list in the custom policy:

* `team/support-issues/read`
* `team/support-issues/write`
* `team/support-issues/triage`
* `team/support-issues/admin`

For more information about each of these RBAC resources, see [Team](team-management-rbac-resource-names#team) in _RBAC Resource Names_.

For more information about how to edit the `allowed:` or `denied:` lists for custom policies in the vendor portal, see [Configuring Custom RBAC Policies](team-management-rbac-configuring).

## Adding Users to the Collab Repository {#add}

This procedure describes how to use the vendor portal to access the collab repository for the first time as an Admin, then automatically add new and existing users to the repository. This allows you to use the vendor portal to manage the GitHub roles for users in the collab repository, rather than manually adding, managing, and removing users from the repository through GitHub. For more information, see [Overview of Managing Collab Access](#overview) above.

### Prerequisites

Your team must have a replicated-collab repository configured to add users to
the repository and to manage repository access through the vendor portal. To get 
a collab support repository configured in GitHub for your team, complete the onboarding 
instructions in the email you received from Replicated. You can also access the [Replicated community help forum](https://community.replicated.com/) for assistance.

### Add Users to the Repository

To add new and existing users to the collab repository through the vendor portal:

1. As a vendor portal admin, log in to your vendor portal account. In the [Account Settings](https://vendor.replicated.com/account-settings) page, add your GitHub username and click **Save Changes**.

   The vendor portal automatically adds your GitHub username to the collab repository and assigns it the Admin role. You receive an email with details about the collab repository when you are added.

1. Follow the collab repository link from the email that you receive to log in to your GitHub account and access the repository.

1. (Recommended) Manually remove any users in the collab repository that were previously added through GitHub.

   :::note
   <CollabExistingUser/>
   :::

1. (Optional) In the vendor portal, go to the [Team](https://vendor.replicated.com/team/members) page. For each team member, click **Edit permissions** as necessary to specify their GitHub role in the collab repository.

   For information about which policies to select, see [Default GitHub Roles](#default) and [About Changing the Default GitHub Role](#custom) above.

1. Instruct each vendor portal team member to add their GitHub username to the [Account Settings](https://vendor.replicated.com/account-settings) page in the vendor portal.

   The vendor portal adds the username to the collab repo and assigns a GitHub role to the user based on their vendor portal policy.

   Users receive an email when they are added to the collab repository.
