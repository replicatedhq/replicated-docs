# Disaster Recovery for Embedded Cluster (Alpha)

This topic describes the disaster recovery feature for Replicated Embedded Cluster, including how to enable disaster recovery for your application. It also describes how end users can configure disaster recovery in the Replicated KOTS Admin Console and restore from a backup.

:::important
Embedded Cluster disaster recovery is an Alpha feature. This feature is subject to change, including breaking changes. To get access to this feature, reach out to Alex Parker at [alexp@replicated.com](mailto:alexp@replicated.com).

:::note
Embedded Cluster does not support backup and restore with the KOTS snapshots feature. For more information about using snapshots for existing cluster installations with KOTS, see [About Backup and Restore with Snapshots](/vendor/snapshots-overview).
:::

## Overview

The Embedded Cluster disaster recovery feature allows your customers to take backups from the Admin Console and perform restores from the command line. Disaster recovery for Embedded Cluster is implemented with Velero. For more information about Velero, see the [Velero](https://velero.io/docs/latest/) documentation.

The backups that your customers take from the Admin Console will include both the Embedded Cluster infrastructure and the application resources that you specify.

The Embedded Cluster infrastructure that is backed up includes components such as the KOTS Admin Console and the built-in registry that is deployed for air gap installations. No configuration is required to include Embedded Cluster infrastructure in backups. Vendors specify the application resources to include in backups by configuring a Velero Backup resource in the application release.

## Requirements

Embedded Cluster disaster recovery has the following requirements:

* The disaster recovery feature flag must be enabled for your account. To get access to disaster recovery, reach out to Alex Parker at [alexp@replicated.com](mailto:alexp@replicated.com).
* Embedded Cluster version 1.22.0 or later
* Backups must be stored in S3-compatible storage

## Limitations and Known Issues

Embedded Cluster disaster recovery has the following limitations and known issues:

* During a restore, the version of the Embedded Cluster installation assets must match the version of the application in the backup. So if version 0.1.97 of your application was backed up, the Embedded Cluster installation assets for 0.1.97 must be used to perform the restore. Use `./APP_SLUG version` to check the version of the installation assets, where `APP_SLUG` is the unique application slug. For example:

   <img alt="version command" src="/images/ec-version-command.png" width="450px"/>

* Any Helm extensions included in the `extensions` field of the Embedded Cluster Config are _not_ included in backups. Helm extensions are reinstalled as part of the restore process. To include Helm extensions in backups, configure the Velero Backup resource to include the extensions using namespace-based or label-based selection. For more information, see [Configure the Velero Custom Resources](#config-velero-resources) below.

* Users can only restore from the most recent backup.

* Velero is installed only during the initial installation process. Enabling the disaster recovery license field for customers after they have already installed will not do anything.

* If the `--admin-console-port` flag was used during install to change the port for the Admin Console, note that during a restore the Admin Console port will be used from the backup and cannot be changed. For more information, see [Embedded Cluster Install Command Options](/reference/embedded-cluster-install).

## Configure Disaster Recovery

This section describes how to configure disaster recovery for Embedded Cluster installations. It also describes how to enable access to the disaster recovery feature on a per-customer basis.

### Configure the Velero Custom Resources {#config-velero-resources}

This section describes how to set up Embedded Cluster disaster recovery for your application by configuring Velero [Backup](https://velero.io/docs/latest/api-types/backup/) and [Restore](https://velero.io/docs/latest/api-types/restore/) custom resources in a release.

To configure Velero Backup and Restore custom resources for Embedded Cluster disaster recovery:

1. In a new release containing your application files, add a Velero Backup resource. In the Backup resource, use namespace-based or label-based selection to indicate the application resources that you want to be included in the backup. For more information, see [Backup API Type](https://velero.io/docs/latest/api-types/backup/) in the Velero documentation.

     :::important
     If you use namespace-based selection to include all of your application resources deployed in the `kotsadm` namespace, ensure that you exclude the Replicated resources that are also deployed in the `kotsadm` namespace. Because the Embedded Cluster infrastructure components are always included in backups automatically, this avoids duplication.
     ::: 

     **Example:**

     The following Backup resource uses namespace-based selection to include application resources deployed in the `kotsadm` namespace:

     ```yaml
     apiVersion: velero.io/v1
     kind: Backup
     metadata:
       name: backup
     spec:
       # Back up the resources in the kotsadm namespace  
       includedNamespaces:
       - kotsadm
       orLabelSelectors:
       - matchExpressions:
         # Exclude Replicated resources from the backup
         - { key: kots.io/kotsadm, operator: NotIn, values: ["true"] }
     ```

1. In the same release, add a Velero Restore resource. In the `backupName` field of the Restore resource, include the name of the Backup resource that you created. For more information, see [Restore API Type](https://velero.io/docs/latest/api-types/restore/) in the Velero documentation.

     **Example**:

     ```yaml
     apiVersion: velero.io/v1
     kind: Restore
     metadata:
       name: restore
     spec:
       # the name of the Backup resource that you created
       backupName: backup
       includedNamespaces:
       - '*'
     ```

1. For any image names that you include in your Backup and Restore resources, rewrite the image name using the Replicated KOTS [HasLocalRegistry](/reference/template-functions-config-context#haslocalregistry), [LocalRegistryHost](/reference/template-functions-config-context#localregistryhost), and [LocalRegistryNamespace](/reference/template-functions-config-context#localregistrynamespace) template functions. This ensures that the image name is rendered correctly during deployment, allowing the image to be pulled from the user's local image registry (such as in air gap installations) or through the Replicated proxy registry.

      **Example:**

      ```yaml
      apiVersion: velero.io/v1
      kind: Restore
      metadata:
        name: restore
      spec:
        hooks:
          resources:
          - name: restore-hook-1
            includedNamespaces:
            - kotsadm
            labelSelector:
              matchLabels:
                app: example
            postHooks:
            - init:
                initContainers:
                - name: restore-hook-init1
                  image: 
                    # Use HasLocalRegistry, LocalRegistryHost, and LocalRegistryNamespace
                    # to template the image name
                    registry: '{{repl HasLocalRegistry | ternary LocalRegistryHost "proxy.replicated.com" }}'
                    repository: '{{repl HasLocalRegistry | ternary LocalRegistryNamespace "proxy/my-app/quay.io/my-org" }}/nginx'
                    tag: 1.24-alpine
      ``` 
      For more information about how to rewrite image names using the KOTS [HasLocalRegistry](/reference/template-functions-config-context#haslocalregistry), [LocalRegistryHost](/reference/template-functions-config-context#localregistryhost), and [LocalRegistryNamespace](/reference/template-functions-config-context#localregistrynamespace) template functions, including additional examples, see [Task 1: Rewrite Image Names](helm-native-v2-using#rewrite-image-names) in _Configuring the HelmChart v2 Custom Resource_.

1. If you support air gap installations, add any images that are referenced in your Backup and Restore resources to the `additionalImages` field of the KOTS Application custom resource. This ensures that the images are included in the air gap bundle for the release so they can be used during the backup and restore process in environments with limited or no outbound internet access. For more information, see [additionalImages](/reference/custom-resource-application#additionalimages) in _Application_.

     **Example:**

     ```yaml
     apiVersion: kots.io/v1beta1
     kind: Application
     metadata:
       name: my-app
     spec:
       additionalImages:
         - elasticsearch:7.6.0
         - quay.io/orgname/private-image:v1.2.3
    ```

1. (Optional) Use Velero functionality like [backup](https://velero.io/docs/main/backup-hooks/) and [restore](https://velero.io/docs/main/restore-hooks/) hooks to customize the backup and restore process as needed.

     **Example:**

     For example, a Postgres database might be backed up using pg_dump to extract the database into a file as part of a backup hook. It can then be restored using the file in a restore hook:

     ```yaml
     podAnnotations:
       backup.velero.io/backup-volumes: backup
       pre.hook.backup.velero.io/command: '["/bin/bash", "-c", "PGPASSWORD=$POSTGRES_PASSWORD pg_dump -U {{repl ConfigOption "postgresql_username" }} -d {{repl ConfigOption "postgresql_database" }} -h 127.0.0.1 > /scratch/backup.sql"]'
       pre.hook.backup.velero.io/timeout: 3m
       post.hook.restore.velero.io/command: '["/bin/bash", "-c", "[ -f \"/scratch/backup.sql\" ] && PGPASSWORD=$POSTGRES_PASSWORD psql -U {{repl ConfigOption "postgresql_username" }} -h 127.0.0.1 -d {{repl ConfigOption "postgresql_database" }} -f /scratch/backup.sql && rm -f /scratch/backup.sql;"]'
       post.hook.restore.velero.io/wait-for-ready: 'true' # waits for the pod to be ready before running the post-restore hook
     ```

1. Save and the promote the release to a development channel for testing.     

### Enable the Disaster Recovery Feature for Your Customers

After configuring disaster recovery for your application, you can enable it on a per-customer basis with the **Allow Disaster Recovery (Alpha)** license field.

To enable disaster recovery for a customer:

1. In the Vendor Portal, go to the [Customers](https://vendor.replicated.com/customers) page and select the target customer.

1. On the **Manage customer** page, under **License options**, enable the **Allow Disaster Recovery (Alpha)** field.
   
   When your customer installs with Embedded Cluster, Velero will be deployed if the **Allow Disaster Recovery (Alpha)** license field is enabled.
	
## Take Backups and Restore

This section describes how your customers can configure backup storage, take backups, and restore from backups.

### Configure Backup Storage and Take Backups in the Admin Console

Customers with the **Allow Disaster Recovery (Alpha)** license field can configure their backup storage location and take backups from the Admin Console.

To configure backup storage and take backups:

1. After installing the application and logging in to the Admin Console, click the **Disaster Recovery** tab at the top of the Admin Console.

1. For the desired S3-compatible backup storage location, enter the bucket, prefix (optional), access key ID, access key secret, endpoint, and region. Click **Update storage settings**.

### Restore from a Backup

To restore from a backup:

1. SSH onto a new machine where you want to restore from a backup.

1. Download the Embedded Cluster installation assets for the version of the application that was included in the backup. You can find the command for downloading Embedded Cluster installation assets in the **Embedded Cluster install instructions dialog** for the customer. For more information, [Online Installation with Embedded Cluster](/enterprise/installing-embedded).

     :::note
     The version of the Embedded Cluster installation assets must match the version that is in the backup. For more information, see [Limitations and Known Issues](#limitations-and-known-issues).
     :::

1. Run the restore command:

     ```bash
     sudo ./APP_SLUG restore
     ```
     Where `APP_SLUG` is the unique application slug.

     Note the following requirements and guidance for the `restore` command:

       * If the installation is behind a proxy, the same proxy settings provided during install must be provided to the restore command using `--http-proxy`, `--https-proxy`, and `--no-proxy`. For more information, see [Embedded Cluster Install Command Options](/reference/embedded-cluster-install).

       * If the `--cidr` flag was used during install to the set IP address ranges for Pods and Services, this flag must be provided with the same CIDR during the restore. If this flag is not provided or is provided with a different CIDR, the restore will fail with an error message telling you to rerun with the appropriate value. However, it will take some time before that error occurs. For more information, see [Embedded Cluster Install Command Options](/reference/embedded-cluster-install).

       * If the `--local-artifact-mirror-port` flag was used during install to change the port for the Local Artifact Mirror (LAM), you can optionally use the `--local-artifact-mirror-port` flag to choose a different LAM port during restore. For example, `restore --local-artifact-mirror-port=50000`. If no LAM port is provided during restore, the LAM port that was supplied during installation will be used. For more information, see [Embedded Cluster Install Command Options](/reference/embedded-cluster-install).

     You will be guided through the process of restoring from a backup.
     
1. When prompted, enter the information for the backup storage location.

     ![Restore prompts on the command line](/images/dr-restore.png)
     [View a larger version of this image](/images/dr-restore.png)

1. When prompted, confirm that you want to restore from the detected backup.

     ![Restore from detected backup prompt on the command line](/images/dr-restore-from-backup-confirmation.png)
     [View a larger version of this image](/images/dr-restore-from-backup-confirmation.png)

     After some time, the Admin console URL is displayed:

     ![Restore from detected backup prompt on the command line](/images/dr-restore-admin-console-url.png)
     [View a larger version of this image](/images/dr-restore-admin-console-url.png)

1. (Optional) If the cluster should have multiple nodes, go to the Admin Console to get a join command and join additional nodes to the cluster. For more information, see [Manage Multi-Node Clusters with Embedded Cluster](/enterprise/embedded-manage-nodes).

1. Type `continue` when you are ready to proceed with the restore process.

     ![Type continue when you are done adding nodes](/images/dr-restore-continue.png)
     [View a larger version of this image](/images/dr-restore-continue.png)

     After some time, the restore process completes.

     If the `restore` command is interrupted during the restore process, you can resume by rerunning the `restore` command and selecting to resume the previous restore. This is useful if your SSH session is interrupted during the restore.
