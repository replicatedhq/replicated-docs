Embedded Cluster does not support backup and restore with the KOTS snapshots feature. For more information about snapshots, see [Understanding Backup and Restore](/vendor/snapshots-overview).
:::

## Overview

The Embedded Cluster disaster recovery feature allows your customers to take backups from the Admin Console and perform restores from the command line using the Embedded Cluster `restore` command.

Backups taken from the Admin Console include both the Embedded Cluster infrastructure and your application resources:
* The infrastructure that is backed up includes components such as KOTS and the built-in registry. No configuration is required.
* The application resources backed up include those that you specify in a Velero Backup custom resource in the release

Disaster recovery for Embedded Cluster is implemented with Velero. For more information about Velero, see the [Velero](https://velero.io/docs/v1.14/) documentation.

## Requirements

Embedded Cluster disaster recovery has the following requirements:

* The disaster recovery feature flag must be enabled for your account. To get access to disaster recovery, reach out to Alex Parker at [alexp@replicated.com](mailto:alexp@replicated.com).
* Embedded Cluster version **X.X.X** or later
* Backups must be stored in S3-compatible storage

## Limitations and Known Issues

Embedded Cluster disaster recovery has the following limitations and known issues:

* During a restore, the version of the Embedded Cluster installation assets must match the version of the application in the backup. So if version 0.1.97 of your application was backed up, the Embedded Cluster installation assets for 0.1.97 must be used to perform the restore. Use `./APP_SLUG version` to check the version of the installation assets, where `APP_SLUG` is the unique application slug. For example:

   <img alt="version command" src="/images/ec-version-command.png" width="450px"/>

* Users can only restore from the most recent backup.

* Velero is installed only during the initial installation process. Enabling the disaster recovery license field for customers after they have already installed will not do anything.

* If the `--admin-console-port` flag was used during install to change the port for the Admin Console, note that during a restore the Admin Console port will be used from the backup and cannot be changed. For more information, see [Embedded Cluster Install Command Options](/reference/embedded-cluster-install).

* Any Helm extensions included in the `extensions` field of the Embedded Cluster Config custom resource are not included in the backup.

## Configure Disaster Recovery for Your Application

This section describes how to set up Embedded Cluster disaster recovery for your application by configuring Velero Backup and Restore custom resources in a release.

To configure disaster recovery:

1. In a new release containing your application files, add a Velero Backup resource. In the Backup resource, use namespace-based or label-based selection to indicate the application resources that you want to be included in the backup. For more information, see [Backup API Type](https://velero.io/docs/latest/api-types/backup/) in the Velero documentation.

     :::note
     If you use namespace-based selection to include your application resources that are deployed in the `kotsadm` namespace, ensure that you also exclude the Replicated resources that are also deployed in the `kotsadm` resource.
     :::

     **Example**:

     The following Backup resource is configured to use namespace-based selection to include application resources in the backup. It is configured to include all resources the `kotsadm` namespace, where both the application and Replicated resources are deployed. The Backup resources also includes an expression in the `orLabelSelectors.matchExpressions` field to ensure that the Replicated resources are excluded from the backup. 

     ```yaml
     apiVersion: velero.io/v1
     kind: Backup
     metadata:
       name: backup
     spec:
       # Back up the resources in the kotsadm namespace  
       includedNamespaces:
       - kotsadm
       orLabelSelectors:
       - matchExpressions:
         # Exclude Replicated resources from the backup
         - { key: kots.io/kotsadm, operator: NotIn, values: ["true"] }
     ```  

1. In the same release, add a Velero Restore resource. In the Restore resource, include the name of the Backup resource that you created in the `backupName` field. For more information, see [Restore API Type](https://velero.io/docs/latest/api-types/restore/) in the Velero documentation.

     **Example**:

     ```yaml
     apiVersion: velero.io/v1
     kind: Restore
     metadata:
       name: restore
     spec:
       # the name of the Backup resource that you added
       backupName: backup
       includedNamespaces:
       - '*'
     ```

{/* 1. Apply the `replicated.com/disaster-recovery: app` label to any Kubernetes resource you want backed up.

     Example HelmChart resource to set the required label on all resources:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: kots.io/v1beta2
    kind: HelmChart
    metadata:
      name: postgresql
    spec:
      chart:
        name: postgresql
        chartVersion: 15.5.0
      values:
        commonLabels:
          replicated.com/disaster-recovery: app
    ``` */}

{/* 1. You must specify which Pod volumes you want backed up. This is done with the `backup.velero.io/backup-volumes` annotation. For more information, see [File System Backup](https://velero.io/docs/v1.14/file-system-backup/) in the Velero documentation.

     Example Helm chart values to set the backup-volumes annotation on the relevant Pod:

     ```yaml
     podAnnotations:
       backup.velero.io/backup-volumes: backup
     ``` */}

1. (Optional) In addition to the previous steps, you can use Velero functionality like [backup](https://velero.io/docs/main/backup-hooks/) and [restore](https://velero.io/docs/main/restore-hooks/) hooks to customize the backup and restore process as needed.

     For example, a Postgres database might be backed up using pg_dump to extract the database into a file as part of a backup hook. It can then be restored using the file in a restore hook:

     ```yaml
     podAnnotations:
       backup.velero.io/backup-volumes: backup
       pre.hook.backup.velero.io/command: '["/bin/bash", "-c", "PGPASSWORD=$POSTGRES_PASSWORD pg_dump -U {{repl ConfigOption "postgresql_username" }} -d {{repl ConfigOption "postgresql_database" }} -h 127.0.0.1 > /scratch/backup.sql"]'
       pre.hook.backup.velero.io/timeout: 3m
       post.hook.restore.velero.io/command: '["/bin/bash", "-c", "[ -f \"/scratch/backup.sql\" ] && PGPASSWORD=$POSTGRES_PASSWORD psql -U {{repl ConfigOption "postgresql_username" }} -h 127.0.0.1 -d {{repl ConfigOption "postgresql_database" }} -f /scratch/backup.sql && rm -f /scratch/backup.sql;"]'
       post.hook.restore.velero.io/wait-for-ready: 'true' # waits for the pod to be ready before running the post-restore hook
     ```

## Enable Disaster Recovery for Your Customers

After configuring disaster recovery for your application, you can enable it on a per-customer basis with the **Allow Disaster Recovery** license field.

To enable disaster recovery for a customer:

1. In the Vendor Portal, go to the [Customers](https://vendor.replicated.com/customers) page and select the target customer.

1. On the **Manage customer** page, under **License options**, enable the **Allow Disaster Recovery (Alpha)** field.
   
   When your customer installs with Embedded Cluster, Velero will be deployed if the **Allow Disaster Recovery** license field is enabled.
	
## Configure Backup Storage and Take Backups in the Admin Console

Customers with the **Allow Disaster Recovery (Alpha)** license field can configure their backup storage location and take backups from the Admin Console.

To configure backup storage and take backups:

1. After installing the application and logging in to the Admin Console, click the **Disaster Recovery** tab at the top of the Admin Console.

1. For the desired S3-compatible backup storage location, enter the bucket, prefix (optional), access key ID, access key secret, endpoint, and region. Click **Update storage settings**.

## Restore from a Backup

To restore from a backup:

1. SSH onto a new machine where you want to restore from a backup.

1. Download the Embedded Cluster installation assets for the version of the application that was included in the backup. You can find the command for downloading Embedded Cluster installation assets in the **Embedded Cluster install instructions dialog** for the customer. For more information, [Online Installation with Embedded Cluster](/enterprise/installing-embedded).

     :::note
     The version of the Embedded Cluster installation assets must match the version that is in the backup. For more information, see [Limitations and Known Issues](#limitations-and-known-issues).
     :::

1. Run the restore command:

     ```bash
     sudo ./APP_SLUG restore
     ```
     Where `APP_SLUG` is the unique application slug.

     Note the following requirements and guidance for the `restore` command:

       * If the installation is behind a proxy, the same proxy settings provided during install must be provided to the restore command using `--http-proxy`, `--https-proxy`, and `--no-proxy`. For more information, see [Embedded Cluster Install Command Options](/reference/embedded-cluster-install).

       * If the `--cidr` flag was used during install to the set IP address ranges for Pods and Services, this flag must be provided with the same CIDR during the restore. If this flag is not provided or is provided with a different CIDR, the restore will fail with an error message telling you to rerun with the appropriate value. However, it will take some time before that error occurs. For more information, see [Embedded Cluster Install Command Options](/reference/embedded-cluster-install).

       * If the `--local-artifact-mirror-port` flag was used during install to change the port for the Local Artifact Mirror (LAM), you can optionally use the `--local-artifact-mirror-port` flag to choose a different LAM port during restore. For example, `restore --local-artifact-mirror-port=50000`. If no LAM port is provided during restore, the LAM port that was supplied during installation will be used. For more information, see [Embedded Cluster Install Command Options](/reference/embedded-cluster-install).

     You will be guided through the process of restoring from a backup.
     
1. When prompted, enter the information for the backup storage location.

     ![Restore prompts on the command line](/images/dr-restore.png)
     [View a larger version of this image](/images/dr-restore.png)

1. When prompted, confirm that you want to restore from the detected backup.

     ![Restore from detected backup prompt on the command line](/images/dr-restore-from-backup-confirmation.png)
     [View a larger version of this image](/images/dr-restore-from-backup-confirmation.png)

     After some time, the Admin console URL is displayed:

     ![Restore from detected backup prompt on the command line](/images/dr-restore-admin-console-url.png)
     [View a larger version of this image](/images/dr-restore-admin-console-url.png)

1. (Optional) If the cluster should have multiple nodes, go to the Admin Console to get a join command and join additional nodes to the cluster. For more information, see [Managing Multi-Node Clusters with Embedded Cluster](/enterprise/embedded-manage-nodes).

1. Type `continue` when you are ready to proceed with the restore process.

     ![Type continue when you are done adding nodes](/images/dr-restore-continue.png)
     [View a larger version of this image](/images/dr-restore-continue.png)

     After some time, the restore process completes.

     If the `restore` command is interrupted during the restore process, you can resume by rerunning the `restore` command and selecting to resume the previous restore. This is useful if your SSH session is interrupted during the restore.
