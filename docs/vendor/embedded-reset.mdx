# Resetting a Node

This topic describes how to use the Embedded Cluster `reset` command to reset a node.

## Overview

Resetting a node removes the cluster and your application from that node. This is useful for iteration, development, and when mistakes are made, so you can reset a machine and reuse it instead of having to procure another machine.

If you want to completely remove a cluster, you need to reset each node individually.

When resetting a node, OpenEBS PVCs on the node are deleted. Only PVCs created as part of a StatefulSet will be recreated automatically on another node. To recreate other PVCs, the application will need to be redeployed.

## Reset a Node

To reset a node:

1. SSH onto the machine. Ensure that the Embedded Cluster binary is still available on that machine.

1. Run the following command to reset the node and automatically reboot the machine to ensure that transient configuration is also reset:

    ```
    sudo ./APP_SLUG reset
    ```
    Where `APP_SLUG` is the unique slug for the application.

    :::note
    Pass the `--no-prompt` flag to disable interactive prompts. Pass the `--force` flag to ignore any errors encountered during the reset.
