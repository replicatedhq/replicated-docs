# Replicated Onboarding (Helm CLI Only)

This topic provides Replicated onboarding steps for vendors on the Builders Plan that support Helm CLI installations only for their application. For information about how to onboard Replicated Platform to support installations with Replicated installers such as Embedded Cluster, see [Replicated Onboarding (Replicated Installers and Helm CLI)](replicated-onboarding).

## Before You Begin

### Best Practices and Recommendations

The following are some best practices and recommendations for successfully onboarding with Replicated:

* When integrating new Replicated features with an application, make changes in small iterations and test frequently by installing or upgrading the application in a development environment. This will help you to more easily identify issues and troubleshoot. This onboarding workflow will guide you through the process of integrating features in small iterations.

* Use the Replicated CLI to create and manage your application and releases. Getting familiar with the Replicated CLI will also help later on when integrating Replicated workflows into your CI/CD pipelines.

* These onboarding tasks show you how to create releases in the Replicated Platform and then test the installation of each release in a cluster using the Helm CLI. For information about how to add support 

### Getting Help from the Community {#community}

The [Replicated community site](https://community.replicated.com/) is a forum where Replicated team members and users can post questions and answers related to working with the Replicated Platform. It is designed to help Replicated users troubleshoot and learn more about common tasks involved with distributing, installing, observing, and supporting their application. 

Before posting in the community site, use the search to find existing knowledge base articles related to your question. If you are not able to find an existing article that addresses your question, create a new topic or add a reply to an existing topic so that a member of the Replicated community or team can respond.

To search and participate in the Replicated community, see https://community.replicated.com/.

## Prerequisites

* Create an account in the Vendor Portal. You can either create a new team or join an existing team. For more information, see [Create a Vendor Account](vendor-portal-creating-account).

* Set up your local workstation with the required toolkit for working with the Replicated Platform. See [Set Up Your Local Workstation](/vendor/environment-setup#local).

* Make sure you have access to a Kubernetes cluster for testing your releases. For information about how to create a cluster, see [Create a Kubernetes Cluster](/vendor/environment-setup#about-creating-a-cluster) in _Set Up Your Environment_.

* Complete a basic tutorial to create an application with a sample Helm chart and then promote and install releases in a development environment. This helps you get familiar with the process of creating, installing, and updating releases in the Replicated Platform. See [Install SlackerNews with the Helm CLI](/vendor/tutorial-helm-cli).

## Onboard

### Task : Create an app in the Vendor portal

To get started with onboarding, first create a new application. This will be the official Vendor Portal application used by your team to create and promote both internal and customer-facing releases.

To create an application:

1. Create a new application using the Replicated CLI or the Vendor Portal. Use an official name for your application. See [Create an Application](/vendor/vendor-portal-manage-app#create-an-application).
   
   <details>
   <summary>Can I change the application name in the future?</summary>

   You can change the application name, but you cannot change the application _slug_.

   The Vendor Portal automatically generates and assigns a unique slug for each application based on the application's name. For example, the slug for "Example App" would be `example-app`.
   
   Application slugs are unique across all of Replicated. This means that, if necessary, the Vendor Portal will append a random word to the end of slug to ensure uniqueness. For example, `example-app-flowers`.
   </details>

1. Set the `REPLICATED_APP` environment variable to the unique slug of the application that you created. This will allow you to interact with the application from the Replicated CLI throughout onboarding. See [Set Environment Variables](/reference/replicated-cli-installing#replicated_app) in _Installing the Replicated CLI_.

   For example:

   ```bash
   export REPLICATED_APP=my-app
   ```

### Task : Add the Replicated SDK to your chart

Next, add the Replicated SDK as a dependency of your Helm chart.

The Replicated SDK is a Helm chart that can be installed as a small service alongside your application. The SDK provides access to key Replicated functionality, including an in-cluster API and automatic access to insights and operational telemetry for instances running in customer environments. For more information, see [About the Replicated SDK](/vendor/replicated-sdk-overview).

To add the Replicated SDK:

* In your application Helm chart `Chart.yaml` file, add the YAML below to declare the SDK as a dependency.
   
   If your application is installed as multiple charts, declare the SDK as a dependency of the chart that customers install first. Do not declare the SDK in more than one chart. For more information, see [Package a Helm Chart for a Release](helm-install-release).

   <DependencyYaml/>

### Task : Configure your chart to use the Replicated proxy registry {#task-2}

The Replicated proxy regsitry allows you to grant proxy access to your application images without exposing registry credentials to your customers.

To use the proxy registry in Helm CLI installations, update your Helm values so that image references point to the Replicated proxy registry rather than to your default registry. Then, add a Secret to your chart to authenticate with the proxy registry.

To configure your chart to use the proxy registry:

1. <StepCreds/>

1. <RewriteHelmValues/>

1. If your application is deployed as multiple Helm charts, repeat the previous step to modify image references in the Helm values for each of your charts.

1. Follow the steps in [Use the Proxy Registry with Helm CLI Installations](/vendor/helm-image-registry) to authenticate with the Replicated proxy registry by creating a Secret with `type: kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson` in your Helm chart.

1. Update dependencies and package the chart as a `.tgz` file:

    <HelmPackage/>

    <UnauthorizedError/>

1. If your application is deployed as multiple Helm charts, package each chart as a separate `.tgz` archive using the `helm package -u PATH_TO_CHART` command.    

1. Add the `.tgz` file(s) to a release. For more information, [Managing Releases with the CLI](releases-creating-cli).

1. Install the release in your development environment to test. See [Install with Helm](/vendor/install-with-helm).

### Task : Add and configure the HelmChart custom resource

For each HelmChart in your release, add the Replicated HelmChart custom resource. This resource allows Replicated to generate a list of images used by your Helm chart, which provides access to features such as air gap installation and reporting on images through the Security Center (Alpha). For more information, see [HelmChart v2](/reference/custom-resource-helmchart-v2).

To add the HelmChart custom resource:

1. In the local directory for your Helm chart, create a subdirectory named `manifests` where you will add the files for the release.

1. Move the `.tgz` chart archive that you packaged to the `manifests` directory. If your application is deployed as multiple Helm charts, move each `.tgz` archive to `manifests`

1. In the `manifests` directory, create a new YAML file named `YOUR_CHART_NAME.yaml`. For example, `samplechart.yaml`. In the file, add the following to create the KOTS HelmChart v2 custom resource for your primary Helm chart, updating the fields as needed to match the name and version of the chart:

    ```yaml
    # HelmChart custom resource
    apiVersion: kots.io/v1beta2
    kind: HelmChart
    metadata:
      name: samplechart
    spec:
      chart:
        # name must match the chart name from the .tgz chart archive
        name: samplechart
        # chartVersion must match the chart version from the .tgz chart archive
        chartVersion: 1.2.3 
    ```

1. If your application is deployed as multiple Helm charts, add and configure a separate HelmChart custom resource for each Helm chart archive in the release.

1. From the `manifests` directory, create a release and promote it to the Unstable channel. For more information, [Managing Releases with the CLI](releases-creating-cli).

    ```bash
    replicated release create --yaml-dir . --promote Unstable
    ```

1. Install the release in your development environment to test. See [Install with Helm](/vendor/install-with-helm).    

### Task : Set up the Enterprise Portal

1. Install the release in your development environment to test. See [Install with Helm](/vendor/install-with-helm).

### Task : Define Prelight Checks

1. Install the release in your development environment to test. See [Install with Helm](/vendor/install-with-helm).

### Task : Add support bundle spec

1. Install the release in your development environment to test. See [Install with Helm](/vendor/install-with-helm).

### Task : Alias replicated endpoints

1. Install the release in your development environment to test. See [Install with Helm](/vendor/install-with-helm).

### (Optional) Task : Add support for air gap installations with the Helm CLI

Replicated supports installations in _air gap_ environments with little or no outbound internet access. For Helm CLI installations, users install by following automatically-generated instructions provided in the Enterprise Portal to pull all images and push them to their local image registry.

To add support for air gap installations:

1. For each Helm chart in your release, configure the corresponding HelmChart custom resource `builder` key. In the `builder` key, define any Helm values that must be set so that the output of `helm template` exposes all container images needed to install the chart in an air-gapped environment. This ensures that the Vendor Portal can build the air gap bundle for the release. See [Package Air Gap Bundles for Helm Charts](/vendor/helm-packaging-airgap-bundles) and [builder](/reference/custom-resource-helmchart-v2#builder).

   <details>
   <summary>How do I know if I need to configure the `builder` key?</summary>
   
   When building an air gap bundle, the Vendor Portal templates the Helm charts in a release with `helm template` in order to detect the images that need to be included in the bundle. Images yielded by `helm template` are included in the bundle for the release.

   For many applications, running `helm template` with the default values would not yield all the images required to install. In these cases, vendors can pass the additional values in the `builder` key to ensure that the air gap bundle includes all the necessary images. If the default values in your Helm chart already expose all the images for air gap installations, then you do not need to configure the `builder` key.
   </details>

1. Create and promote a new release with your changes. For more information, see [Managing Releases with the CLI](releases-creating-cli).

1. In the [Vendor Portal](https://vendor.replicated.com), go the channel where the release was promoted to build the air gap bundle. Do one of the following:
     * If the **Automatically create airgap builds for newly promoted releases in this channel** setting is enabled on the channel, watch for the build status to complete.
     * If automatic air gap builds are not enabled, go to the **Release history** page for the channel and build the air gap bundle manually.

1. Create or edit a customer with the Helm CLI air gap entitlement enabled so that you can test air gap installations. See [Create and Manage Customers](/vendor/releases-creating-customer).

1. Follow the steps in [Install and Update with Helm in Air Gap Environments](/vendor/helm-install-airgap) to access the Enterprise Portal for the customer and test air gap installation in a cluster with Helm.
