# Step 4: Create a Release

Now that you have the manifest files for the sample Kubernetes application, you can create a release for the `cli-tutorial` application and promote the release to the Unstable channel.

By default, Replicated includes Unstable, Beta, and Stable release channels. The Unstable channel is intended for software vendors to use for internal testing, before promoting a release to the Beta or Stable channels for distribution to customers. For more information about channels, see [About Release Channels](releases-about-channels).

To create and promote a release to the Unstable channel:

1. Run the following command to lint the application manifest files and ensure that there are no errors in the YAML:

  ```
  replicated release lint --yaml-dir=manifests
  ```

  If there are no errors, an empty list is displayed with a zero exit code:

  ```text
  RULE    TYPE    FILENAME    LINE    MESSAGE
  ```

  For a complete list of the possible error, warning, and informational messages that can appear in the ouput of the `release lint` command, see [KOTS Lint Rules](/reference/kots-lint).

1. Initialize the project as a Git repository:

  ```
  git init
  git add .
  git commit -m "Initial Commit: CLI Tutorial"
  ```

  Initializing the project as a Git repository allows you to track your history. The replicated CLI also reads Git metadata to help with the generation of release metadata, such as version labels.

1. Run the following command from the `replicated-cli-tutorial` directory to prepare a release with the default settings:

  ```
  replicated release create --auto
  ```

  The `--auto` flag generates release notes and metadata based on the Git status.

  **Example output:**

  ```

    Prepared to create release with defaults:

        yaml-dir        "./manifests"
        promote         "Unstable"
        version         "Unstable-ba710e5"
        release-notes   "CLI release of master triggered by exampleusername [SHA: d4173a4] [31 Oct 22 08:51 MDT]"
        ensure-channel  true
        lint-release    true

    Create with these properties? [Y/n]
  ```

1. Type `y` and press Enter to confirm the prompt.

  **Example output:**

  ```text

    • Promoting ✓
      • Channel VEr0nhJBBUdaWpPvOIK-SOryKZEwa3Mg successfully set to release 1
  ```
  The release is created and promoted to the Unstable channel.

1. Run the following command to confirm that the release was promoted to the Unstable channel:

  ```
  replicated release ls
  ```
  **Example output:**

  ```text
  SEQUENCE    CREATED                 EDITED                  ACTIVE_CHANNELS
  1           2022-10-31T14:55:35Z    0001-01-01T00:00:00Z    Unstable
  ```

Now that the first release for the `cli-tutorial` applcation is promoted to a channel, you can complete the steps to install and deploy the application in your Kubernetes cluster. Continue to [Step 5: Create a Customer](tutorial-cli-create-customer) to create a customer license file that you will upload when installing the application.
