### Comparison to the Download Portal

The Enterprise Portal is the next generation version of the Replicated Download Portal. Compared to the Download Portal, the Enterprise Portal not only provides access to installation assets and instructions like in the Download Portal, but also allows users to track available updates, manage their team and service accounts, view the status of their instances, and more. These features are designed to make it easier for your customers to manage their instances of your application from a centralized location outside of the installation environment.

You can migrate existing customers from the Download Portal to the Enterprise Portal by enabling the Enterprise Portal for their license. For more information, see [Manage Enterprise Portal Access](enterprise-portal-invite).

## About Customizing the Enterprise Portal

You can customize the Enterprise Portal to use a custom domain, provide custom links and contact information, customize the look and feel of the Enterprise Portal, edit the content of invitation and notification emails, and more. This helps ensure that your customers have a consistent branding experience.
