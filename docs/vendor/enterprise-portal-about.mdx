# About the Enterprise Portal (Beta)

This topic provides an overview of the Replicated Enterprise Portal.

## Overview

The Enterprise Portal is a customizable, web-based portal that provides a centralized location where your Embedded Cluster and Helm CLI installation method customers can:
* View application install and update instructions
* Manage their team members and service accounts
* Upload support bundles
* View insights about their active and inactive instances
* And more

The following shows an example of the Enterprise Portal dashboard:

Your customers can access the Enterprise Portal outside their application installation environment at a custom domain that you specify, making it easier for teams to manage instances and get support. 

The following diagram shows how customers can use the Enterprise Portal to access release assets and installation instructions, as well as upload support bundles:

As shown in the diagram above, your licensed customers can access the installation and update instructions for one or more application releases by logging in to the Enterprise Portal. The Enterprise Portal tracks the customer's installation attempts and progress, and shares those insights back to the Vendor Portal. After installing, customers can also upload support bundles in the Enterprise Portal. Support bundles uploaded to the Enterprise Portal are automatically made available to you in the Vendor Portal. 

You can enable and disable access to the Enterprise Portal for all customers, or on a per-customer basis. For more information about how to enable access, see [Manage Customer Access](/vendor/enterprise-portal-invite#manage-ep-access).

For information about using the Enterprise Portal, see [Access and Use the Enterprise Portal](enterprise-portal-use).

## Limitations

* The Enterprise Portal is Beta. The features and functionality of the Enterprise Portal are subject to change.

* Installation and upgrade instructions are available only for Embedded Cluster and Helm installations. The Enterprise Portal does not provide instructions for installing and upgrading with KOTS in existing clusters, or with kURL installer clusters.

* Air gap instance records do not appear in the Enterprise Portal until the end customer creates an air gap instance record by either uploading a support bundle for that instance or manually entering instance information. For more information, see [View Active and Inactive Instances](/vendor/enterprise-portal-use#view-active-and-inactive-instances) in _Access and Use the Enterprise Portal_.

* There is a known issue when using a custom domain for the Enterprise Portal if any of your customers use link transformers such as Microsoft Defender Safe Links. For more information, see [Known Issue](custom-domains#known-issue) in _About Custom Domains_. 

## Comparison to the Download Portal

The Enterprise Portal is the next generation version of the Replicated Download Portal. Compared to the Download Portal, the Enterprise Portal not only provides access to installation assets and instructions, but also allows users to track available updates, manage their team and service accounts, view the status of their instances, view license details, and more. These features are designed to make it easier for your customers to manage their instances of your application from a centralized location outside of the installation environment.

You can migrate existing Embedded Cluster and Helm CLI installation method customers from the Download Portal to the Enterprise Portal by enabling the Enterprise Portal for their license. For more information, see [Manage Enterprise Portal Access](enterprise-portal-invite).

KOTS Existing Cluster and KURL installation method customers should continue to utilize the Download Portal to retrieve needed installation assets. 

For more information about the Download Portal, see [Access a Customer's Download Portal](/vendor/releases-share-download-portal).

## About Customizing the Enterprise Portal

You can configure the Enterprise Portal to use a custom domain, add links and contact information, customize the look and feel of the Enterprise Portal, edit the content of invitation and notification emails, and more. Customizing the Enterprise Portal helps ensure that your customers have a consistent branding experience and can access application- and vendor-specific information.

For more information about customizing the Enterprise Portal, see [Customize the Enterprise Portal](enterprise-portal-configure).

For information about how to set a custom domain for the Enterprise Portal, see [Use Custom Domains](/vendor/custom-domains-using). 

## About Instance Reporting with the Enterprise Portal

This section describes the instance reporting functionality of the Enterprise Portal.

### Active and Inactive Instances

The Enterprise Portal provides insights to end users about their active and inactive instances, including the application version installed, the instance status, computed metrics like the first and most recent times the instance sent data to the Vendor Portal, and more. For more information about the instance insights available in the Enterprise Portal, see [View Active and Inactive Instances](/vendor/enterprise-portal-use#view-active-and-inactive-instances) in _Access and Use the Enterprise Portal_.

### Customer Reporting

The Enterprise Portal sends insights back to the Vendor Portal, which are surfaced on the **Customer Reporting** page. For more information, see [Enterprise Portal](/vendor/customer-reporting#enterprise-portal-beta) in _Customer Reporting_.

These insights include details about the customer's install attempts. The Enterprise Portal tracks and reports on install attempts by creating unique, _just-in-time_ service accounts. These service accounts allow the Enterprise Portal to send data back to the Vendor Portal when the user starts and completes the installation or takes other actions that are specific to the installation type. The service accounts also provide realtime feedback to the user on their installation progress using checkboxes and status indicators, and allow users to pause and return to an installation attempt. For more information, see [Install Attempts](/vendor/customer-reporting#install-attempts-beta) in _Customer Reporting_.

The following shows an example of the **Install Attempts** section:
