# About the Enterprise Portal

This topic provides an overview of the Replicated Enterprise Portal.

## Overview

The Enterprise Portal is a web-based portal that provides a centralized location where your end customers can find installation and upgrade instructions, manage their license, manage team memebers and service accounts, collect and upload support bundles, and more.

The Enterprise Portal includes customer-specific, customizable installation and upgrade instructions that are automatically generated based on the customer's license details.

## Comparison to the Download Portal

The Enterprise Portal is the next generation version of the Download Portal.

You can migrate your customers from the Download Portal to the Enterprise Portal by enabling the Enterprise Portal for their license. For more information, see [Enable the Enterprise Portal for a Customer](enterprise-portal-invite) in _Invite Customers to the Enterprise Portal_.
