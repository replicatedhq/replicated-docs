# Perform a Headless Installation of SlackerNews

This topic provides a tutorial that demonstrates how to perform a headless installation for an application distributed with Replicated.

## Introduction

This tutorial shows how to install a Helm chart with Replicated Embedded Cluster from the command line without interacting with the Admin Console UI. This is also known as a _headless_ installation. Headless installations are often used for automating application deployment as part of CI/CD pipelines.

In this tutorial, you will:

* Download the Helm chart and release manifests for the sample application (SlackerNews)

* Create a release for SlackerNews in the Replicated Platform

* Create a ConfigValues file to pass application-specific configuration values to the installation from the command line

* Run the Embedded Cluster `install` command to perform a headless install of SlackerNews in a VM

## Set Up Your Environment

Before you begin, do the following to set up your environment:

* Install the Helm CLI, which is the tool for interacting with Helm and managing Helm charts. See [Install Helm](/vendor/environment-setup#install-helm).

* Ensure that you have access to a VM that meets the requirements for Embedded Cluster:

   * **Option 1: Use Compatibility Matrix.** To use Replicated Compatibility Matrix to create a VM, do the following before proceeding:
      
      * Request Compatibility Matrix credits. You can request credits by creating a Vendor Portal account and then going to [**Compatibility Matrix > Request more credits**](https://vendor.replicated.com/compatibility-matrix) in the Vendor Portal. For more information about creating an account, see [Create a Vendor Account](vendor-portal-creating-account). For more information about Compatibility Matrix credits, see [Billing and Credits](/vendor/testing-about#billing-and-credits).

          :::note
          If you are new to the Replicated platform, you might be eligible for $100 in free Compatibility Matrix credits. To request your free credits, reach out to our sales team at https://www.replicated.com/contact and note in the comments that you are completing the Replicated Quick Start.
          :::
      
      * Ensure that you have an SSH key in your GitHub account. Then, add your GitHub username to your Vendor Portal [**Account Settings**](https://vendor.replicated.com/account-settings). This will provide SSH access to VMs that you create with Compatibility Matrix. For more information, see [Set Up SSH Access](/vendor/testing-vm-create#set-up-ssh-access) in _Create VMs_.

      After you complete the prerequisites above, continue to the [Quick Start](#quick-start). You will create the VM with Compatibility Matrix as part of the tutorial.

   * **Option 2: Bring your own VM.** Your VM must meet these requirements:

      * Firewalls must allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic.

      <Requirements/>

## Tutorial

1. Create an application using the Replicated CLI:

    1. On your local machine, install the Replicated CLI:

       * MacOS

         ```bash
         brew install replicatedhq/replicated/cli
         ```
       * Linux / Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

         ```bash
         version=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/replicatedhq/replicated/releases/latest \
           | grep -m1 -Po '"tag_name":\s*"v\K[^"]+')
         curl -Ls \
           "https://github.com/replicatedhq/replicated/releases/download/v${version}/replicated_${version}_linux_amd64.tar.gz" \
           -o replicated.tar.gz
         tar xf replicated.tar.gz replicated && rm replicated.tar.gz
         mv replicated /usr/local/bin/replicated
         ``` 
       For more information and additional installation options, see [Install the Replicated CLI](/reference/replicated-cli-installing).

    1. Authorize the Replicated CLI:

      ```bash
      replicated login
      ```
      In the browser window that opens, follow the prompt to log in to your Vendor Portal account and authorize the CLI.

   1. Create an application named `SlackerNews`:

      ```bash
      replicated app create SlackerNews
      ```

   1. Set the `REPLICATED_APP` environment variable to the application that you created:

      ```bash
      export REPLICATED_APP=APP_SLUG
      ```
      Where `APP_SLUG` is the unique application slug provided in the output of the `app create` command.

      Setting the `REPLICATED_APP` environment variable allows you to interact with the application using the Replicated CLI without needing to use the `--app` flag with every command.  

1. Get the release files and Helm chart archive for SlackerNews:

    1. Run the following command to download version 1.0.1 of the sample SlackerNews Helm chart to a new `quick-start` directory: 

      ```bash
      curl -O --create-dirs --output-dir quick-start https://docs.replicated.com/slackernews-1.0.1.tar.gz
      ```

    1. Untar the chart:

      ```bash
      tar -xzf quick-start/slackernews-1.0.1.tar.gz -C quick-start/ && rm quick-start/slackernews-1.0.1.tar.gz
      ```

    1. Download and untar the release manifests:

1. Create the release:

     1. Lint the YAML files in the `manifests` directory:

        ```bash
        replicated release lint --yaml-dir .
        ```
        **Example output:**
        ```bash
        RULE                                TYPE   FILENAME             LINE   MESSAGE
        may-contain-secrets                 info   slackernews.yaml     142    It looks like there might be secrets in this file
        preflight-spec                      warn                               Missing preflight spec
        troubleshoot-spec                   warn                               Missing troubleshoot spec
        nonexistent-status-informer-object  warn   replicated-app.yaml  14     Status informer points to a nonexistent kubernetes object. If this is a Helm resource, this warning can be ignored.
        nonexistent-status-informer-object  warn   replicated-app.yaml  15     Status informer points to a nonexistent kubernetes object. If this is a Helm resource, this warning can be ignored.
        nonexistent-status-informer-object  warn   replicated-app.yaml  16     Status informer points to a nonexistent kubernetes object. If this is a Helm resource, this warning can be ignored.
        ```
        :::note
        You can ignore `info` or `warn` messages for the purpose of this quick start.
        :::      

    1. From the `manifests` directory, create a release and promote it to the Unstable channel:

        ```bash
        replicated release create --yaml-dir . --promote Unstable
        ```
        **Example output**:
        ```bash
        • Reading manifests from . ✓
        • Creating Release ✓
            • SEQUENCE: 1
        • Promoting ✓
            • Channel 2kvjwEj4uBaCMoTigW5xty1iiw6 successfully set to release 1
        ```

1. Create the ConfigValues file:

     ```yaml
     apiVersion: kots.io/v1beta1
     kind: ConfigValues
     spec:
     values:
       slackernews_domain:
         value: YOUR_DOMAIN
     ```
     Where `YOUR_DOMAIN` is the domain to use for SlackerNews. For Compatibility Matrix VMs, this is the hostname provided for the DNS record you created with port 443.

   Save the ConfigValues on your local machine. You will transfer this file to your VM as part of a later step.

1. Create a test customer so that you can install the release in your VM with Embedded Cluster:

   1. Log in to the [Vendor Portal](https://vendor.replicated.com).
   
   1. Under the application drop down, select the SlackerNews application that you created.

      <img alt="App drop down" src="/images/quick-start-app-dropdown-slackernews.png" width="250px"/>

      [View a larger version of this image](/images/quick-start-app-dropdown-slackernews.png)
   
   1. Click **Customers > Create customer**.

      The **Create a new customer** page opens:

      ![Customer a new customer page in the Vendor Portal](/images/create-customer.png)

      [View a larger version of this image](/images/create-customer.png)

   1. For **Customer name**, enter a name for the customer. For example, `Example Customer`.

   1. For **Assigned Channel**, select **Unstable**. This allows the customer to install releases promoted to the Unstable channel.

   1. For **Customer type**, select **Development**.

   1. For **Install types**, enable **Embedded Cluster (current generation product)** and disable the other install type options.

   1. Click **Save Changes**.

1. If you brought your own VM, SSH onto your VM. Otherwise, follow these steps to create and SSH onto a VM with Compatibility Matrix:

   1. Create an Ubuntu VM that expires after two hours:

      ```bash
      replicated vm create --distribution ubuntu --version 24.04 --instance-type r1.small --disk 50 --ttl 2h
      ```
      **Example output:**
      ```bash
      ID        NAME             DISTRIBUTION  VERSION  STATUS  NETWORK   CREATED               EXPIRES   COST
      97940819  practical_black  ubuntu        24.04    queued  c726ffff  2025-08-20 14:32 MDT  -         $0.69
      ```

   1. After a few minutes, check the status of the VM to see when it is `running`:

      ```bash
      replicated vm ls
      ```
      **Example output:**
      ```bash
      ID        NAME             DISTRIBUTION  VERSION  STATUS   NETWORK   CREATED               EXPIRES                COST
      97940819  practical_black  ubuntu        24.04    running  c726ffff  2025-08-20 14:32 MDT  2025-08-20 16:33 MDT   $0.69
      ```
   
   1. Run the following command to use the Compatibility Matrix Forwarder to SSH onto the VM:

      ```bash
      ssh VM_ID@replicatedvm.com
      ```
      Where `VM_ID` is the `ID` from the output of the `replicated vm ls` command.

      :::note
      If you are prompted to add the fingerprint for replicatedvm.com, type `yes` and press Enter.
      :::

   1. When prompted, provide the passphrase for the SSH key in your linked GitHub account. Compatibility Matrix uses GitHub SSH to provide access to the VM.

1. On your VM, run the first two commands in the **Embedded cluster install instructions** dialog to download the latest release and extract the installation assets. Do not yet run the installation command.

1. Transfer the ConfigValues to your VM using scp.

1. Run the following command to install:

1. Open a shell to watch the application resources deploy.

     1. `sudo ./APP_SLUG shell`

     1. `kubectl get all --namespace slackernews`

1. Go to the domain that you listed for the SlackerNews to open the application.
