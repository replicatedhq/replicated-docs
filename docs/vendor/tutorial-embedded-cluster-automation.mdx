# Tutorial: Automate Installation with Embedded Cluster

This tutorial shows how to install a release using Embedded Cluster from the command line without using the Admin Console UI. This is also known as a _headless_ installation.

## Set Up

Get access to a VM.

## Tutorial

1. Create an app.

1. Get the release files and Helm chart archive.

1. Add the files to a new release with `replicated release create --yaml-dir manifests --promote Unstable`.

1. Create a customer with Embedded Cluster installation.

1. If you are using Compatibility Matrix, create the VM:

     1. Create the VM
     1. Create the DNS records.

1. SSH onto your VM.

1. Download the installation assets and untar. You can add these commands to CI/CD workflows to automate this step.

1. Create the ConfigValues file:

     ```yaml
     apiVersion: kots.io/v1beta1
     kind: ConfigValues
     spec:
     values:
       slackernews_domain:
         value: YOUR_DOMAIN
   ```
   Where `YOUR_DOMAIN` is the domain to use for SlackerNews. For Compatibility Matrix VMs, this is the hostname provided for the DNS record you created with port 443.

1. Transfer the ConfigValues to your VM using scp.

1. Run the following command to install:

1. Open a shell to watch the application resources deploy.

     1. `sudo ./APP_SLUG shell`

     1. `kubectl get all --namespace slackernews`

1. Go to the domain that you listed for the SlackerNews to open the application.
