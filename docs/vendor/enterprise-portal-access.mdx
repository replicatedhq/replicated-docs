# Access a Customer's Enterprise Portal

This topic describes how you can access the Enterprise Portal for a customer from the Vendor Portal. This is useful when testing your application installation and upgrade instructions, previewing customizations that you made to the Enterprise Portal, or managing Enterprise Portal users for a customer.

For information about how users sign up for an account and log in to the Enterprise Portal, see [Log In To and Use the Enterprise Portal](enterprise-portal-use).

## Log In Without an Account Using a One-Time Link

You can access the Enterprise Portal for a customer using a one-time login. This is useful for quickly accessing the Enteprise Portal, or when you do not have or cannot create an account in the customer's Enterprise Portal.

To access the Enterprise Portal for a customer with a one-time login:

1. In the Vendor Portal, go to **Customers > [Customer Name] > Enterprise Portal Access**.

1. In the **Login to portal** section, click **Login a customer**. This generates a one-time login and opens the Enterprise Portal for the customer.

If your email address is not yet added to the customer's Enterprise Portal team, send an invitation before attempting to log in. See [Invite Users](enterprise-portal-invite#invite-users).
