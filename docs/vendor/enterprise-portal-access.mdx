# Access a Customer's Enterprise Portal

This topic describes how you can access the Enterprise Portal for a customer from the Vendor Portal. This is useful when testing your application installation and upgrade instructions, previewing customizations that you made to the Enterprise Portal, or managing Enterprise Portal users on behalf of one of your customers.

For information about how end users can sign up for an account and log in to the Enterprise Portal, see [Log In To and Use the Enterprise Portal](enterprise-portal-use).

## Log In Using a One-Time Link

You can access the Enterprise Portal for a customer using a one-time login. This is useful for quickly accessing the Enteprise Portal, or if you must not create an account in the customer's Enterprise Portal.

To access the Enterprise Portal for a customer with a one-time login:

1. In the Vendor Portal, go to **Customers > [Customer Name] > Enterprise Portal Access**.

1. In the **Login to portal** section, click **Login to portal**. This generates a one-time login and opens the Enterprise Portal for the customer.
