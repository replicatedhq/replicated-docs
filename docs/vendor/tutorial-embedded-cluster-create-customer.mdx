# Step 4: Create an Embedded Cluster-enabled Customer

After promoting the release, create a customer with the Replicated KOTS and Embedded Cluster entitlements so that you can install the release with Embedded Cluster. A _customer_ represents a single licensed user of your application.

To create a customer:

1. In the [Vendor Portal](https://vendor.replicated.com), click **Customers > Create customer**.

   The **Create a new customer** page opens:

   ![Customer a new customer page in the Vendor Portal](/images/create-customer.png)

1. For **Customer name**, enter a name for the customer. For example, `Example Customer`.

1. For **Channel**, select **Unstable**. This allows the customer to install releases promoted to the Unstable channel.

1. For **License type**, select **Development**.

1. For **License options**, enable the following entitlements:
     * **KOTS Install Enabled**
     * **Embedded Cluster Enabled (Beta)**

1. Click **Save Changes**.
