Replicated support for end-customer installations is limited to those installs using a Replicated provided installer product, such as KOTS or kURL, available with the [Business or Enterprise plans](https://www.replicated.com/pricing). Replicated support for direct Helm CLI installs or other vendor provided installers is limited to the successful distribution of the software to the end-customer, as well as any issues with the Replicated SDK if included with the installation.
