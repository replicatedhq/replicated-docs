# Using a Registry Proxy for Helm Air Gap Installations (Alpha)

This topic describes how to connect the Replicated proxy registry to a Harbor or jFrog Artifactory instance to support pull-through image caching. It also includes information about how to set up replication rules in Harbor for image mirroring.

## Overview

For applications distributed with Replicated, the [Replicated proxy registry](/vendor/private-images-about) grants proxy, or _pull-through_, access to application images without exposing registry credentials to customers.

Users can optionally connect the Replicated proxy registry with their own [Harbor](https://goharbor.io) or [jFrog Artifactory](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-artifactory-documentation) instance to proxy and cache the images that are required for installation on demand. This can be particularly helpful in Helm installations in air-gapped environments because it allows users to pull and cache images from an internet-connected machine, then access the cached images during installation from a machine with limited or no outbound internet access.   

In addition to the support for on-demand pull-through caching, connecting the Replicated proxy registry to a Harbor or Artifactory instance also has the following benefits:
* Registries like Harbor or Artifactory typically support access controls as well as scanning images for security vulnerabilities
* With Harbor, users can optionally set up replication rules for image mirroring, which can be used to improve data availability and reliability

## Limtiation

Artifactory does not support mirroring or replication for Docker registries. If you need to set up image mirroring, use Harbor. See [Set Up Mirroring in Harbor](#harbor-mirror) below.

## Connect the Replicated Proxy Registry to Harbor

[Harbor](https://goharbor.io) is a popular open-source container registry that supports both pull-through proxy caching and repository mirroring through _pull based_ replication rules.

Users can add the Replicated proxy registry to Harbor in order to cache images on demand and set up replication rules to proactively mirror images. Connecting the Replicated proxy registry to Harbor also allows customers use Harbor's security features.

### Use Harbor for Pull-Through Proxy Caching {#harbor-proxy-cache}

To connect the Replicated proxy registry to Harbor for pull-through proxy caching:

1. Log in to Harbor and create a new replication endpoint. This endpoint connects the Replicated proxy registry to the Harbor instance. For more information, see [Creating Replication Endpoints](https://goharbor.io/docs/2.11.0/administration/configuring-replication/create-replication-endpoints/) in the Harbor documentation.

1. Enter the following details for the endpoint:

    * For the provider field, choose Docker Registry.
    * For the URL field, enter `https://proxy.replicated.com` or the custom domain that is configured for the Replicated proxy registry. For more information about configuring custom domains in the Vendor Portal, see [Using Custom Domains](/vendor/custom-domains-using). 
    * For the access ID, enter the email address associated with the customer in the Vendor Portal.
    * For the access secret, enter the customer's unique license ID. You can find the license ID in the Vendor Portal by going to **Customers > [Customer Name]**.

1. Verify your configuration by testing the connection and then save the endpoint.  

1. After adding the Replicated proxy registry as a replication endpoint in Harbor, set up a proxy cache. This allows for pull-through image caching with Harbor. For more information, see [Configure Proxy Cache](https://goharbor.io/docs/2.11.0/administration/configure-proxy-cache/) in the Harbor documentation.

1. (Optional) Add a pull-based replication rule to support image mirroring. See [Configure Image Mirroring in Harbor](#harbor-mirror) below.

### Configure Image Mirroring in Harbor {#harbor-mirror}

To enable image mirroring with Harbor, users create a pull-based replication rule. This periodically (or when manually triggered) pulls images from the Replicated proxy registry to store them in Harbor. 

The Replicated proxy regsitry exposes standard catalog and tag listing endpoints that are used by Harbor to support image mirroring:
* The catalog endpoint returns a list of repositories built from images of the last 10 releases.
* The tags listing endpoint lists the tags available in a given repository for those same releases.

When image mirroring is enabled, Harbor uses these endpoints to build a list of images to cache and then serve.

#### Limitations

Image mirroring with Harbor has the following limitations:

* Neither the catalog or tags listing endpoints exposed by the Replicated proxy service respect pagination requests. However, Harbor requests 1000 items at a time.

* Only authenticated users can perform catalog calls or list tags. Authenticated users are those with an email address and license ID associated with a customer in the Vendor Portal.

#### Create a Pull-Based Replication Rule in Harbor for Image Mirroring

To configure image mirroring in Harbor:

1. Follow the steps in [Use Harbor for Pull-Through Proxy Caching](#harbor-proxy-cache) above to add the Replicated proxy registry to Harbor as a replication endpoint.

1. Create a **pull-based** replication rule in Harbor to mirror images proactively. For more information, see [Creating a replication rule](https://goharbor.io/docs/2.11.0/administration/configuring-replication/create-replication-rules/) in the Harbor documentation.

## Use Artifactory for Pull-Through Proxy Caching

[jFrog Artifactory](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-artifactory-documentation) supports pull-through caching for Docker registries.

For information about how to configure a pull-through cache with Artifactory, see [Remote Repository](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-artifactory-documentation/configure-a-remote-repository) in the Artifactory documentation.
