# About Event Notifications (Beta)

:::note
Event Notifications is in Beta. Features and functionality are subject to change as we continue to iterate this functionality towards General Availability.
:::

The ability to set up notifications for key events of interest within Vendor Portal can help you proactively manage and prevent issues.

## Overview

Event Notifications allow you to subscribe to specific events and receive alerts via email or webhook. You can create highly targeted notifications using filters to focus on the events that matter most to your workflow.

Event types are predefined, but you can cover a broad range of use cases by leveraging available filtering conditions on a given event, including filters by application, customer, channel, license type, and custom license field values (entitlements).

Events are queued to SQS for reliable processing and notifications are matched against event filters in real-time. Email notifications are sent via the configured email service, and webhook notifications include HMAC signatures for verification.

To get started, review the available event types below, plan your filters based on your workflow needs (by customer, channel, license type, etc.), and choose your delivery method (email or webhook). Then create your first notification using the steps in [Create Event Notification Subscriptions (Beta)](event-notifications-create) and monitor the notification history to refine your filters as needed.

## Comparison: Classic Instance Notifications vs. Event Notifications (Beta)

Event Notifications offers significant improvements over the classic [Instance Notifications (Classic)](instance-notifications-config) system, including more event types, fine-grained filtering, flexible routing to individual or team email addresses or webhooks, notification history tracking, and better access control.

| Feature | Classic Instance Notifications | Event Notifications (Beta) |
|---------|------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Event Types** | 3 types (App Status, System Events, Custom Metrics) | 19+ types across 6 categories |
| **Scope** | Per-instance subscriptions | Team-wide with flexible filtering |
| **Delivery** | Slack (1 team webhook) + Email (1 user) | Per notification email or webhook |
| **Filtering** | Instance-level only | Multi-field filters (app, customer, channel, etc.) |
| **Permissions** | User-scoped | Team-scoped RBAC |
| **Webhook Security** | Basic | HMAC-SHA256 signing |
| **Notification History** | Minimal | Full delivery attempt tracking with event details |

## Permissions

Event Notifications uses team-scoped RBAC permissions to control access. Your ability to view and manage notifications depends on your role:

### Admin Role
- Can manage any team-created notifications in addition to their own
- Can modify, delete, and turn off/on any notification
- Full access to all notification features

### Read Only Role
- Cannot create notifications
- Can view all team notifications and their event history
- No modification permissions

### Other Non-Admin Roles with Write Access
(Examples: Support Engineer, Sales, Custom roles)
- Can create and modify their own notifications
- Broader team notifications are viewable but not modifiable (read-only)
- Cannot edit or delete notifications created by other team members

:::note
When isolating changes to "my" notifications, the logic is based on your user ID being tied to that notification creation record. You may still send to other email addresses not directly associated with your user ID, but those email addresses will need to be verified before the notification will activate.

For detailed information about custom RBAC policies and notification permissions, see [Create Event Notification Subscriptions (Beta)](event-notifications-create).

## Limitations

Current limitations of Event Notifications (Beta):

- Event Notifications does not yet cover all instance and custom metric event types from the classic Instance Notifications feature, including Instance health state changed (aka Instance State Changed)
- Notification events generated are not included in the [Instance Bulk Data Export API](instance-data-export)
- It is possible to create a notification for some resource types, such as customers and support bundles, but not be able to access the notification linked asset due to your allowed user permissions. This is most likely to impact teams with [enterprise and custom RBAC policies](team-management-rbac-configuring). For example, someone with the [Sales RBAC role](team-management-rbac-configuring) can create a notification for a customer uploading a support bundle, but does not have permission to view the linked specific customer bundle due to their RBAC role permissions.
- The Release Assets Downloaded event may fire per chart/image if the customer pulls each separately as part of your installation instructions. As these assets can be shared across many release versions, the access event is recorded at the chart/image level and is not easily identifiable to a specific release version. If you find this alert too noisy, please reach out to us to further discuss your specific use case.

:::note
Event Notifications can be used concurrently with the classic Instance Notifications system while you evaluate and transition.
