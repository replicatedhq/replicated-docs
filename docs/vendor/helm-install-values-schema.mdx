# Helm global.replicated Values Schema

This topic describes the `global.replicated` values that are injected into a Helm chart's `values.yaml` by the Replicated registry. The information in this topic applies to Helm CLI installations with Replicated.

## Overview

During Helm CLI installations with Replicated, the application Helm chart(s) are pulled from the Replicated registry. When an authenticated user pulls a chart from the Replicated registry (with `helm pull`, `helm install`, or `helm upgrade`, or from any OCI-compatible client), the Replicated registry injects customer-specific values into the `global.replicated` key of the chart's `values.yaml` file before serving the chart.

These customer-specific values that are injected into the `global.replicated` key include:

* The fields in the customer's license, such as the field names, descriptions, signatures, values, and any custom license fields that you define. Vendors can use this license information to check entitlements before the application is installed. For more information, see [Check Entitlements in Helm Charts Before Deployment](/vendor/licenses-reference-helm).

* A base64-encoded Docker configuration file (`global.replicated.dockerconfigjson`) that contains registry authentication credentials. To proxy images from an external private registry with the Replicated proxy registry, you use this `global.replicated.dockerconfigjson` field to create an image pull secret for the proxy registry. For more information, see [Use the Proxy Registry with Helm CLI Installations](/vendor/helm-image-registry).

The following is an example of a Helm values file containing the `global.replicated` values:

```yaml
# Helm values.yaml
global:
  replicated:
    channelName: Stable
    customerEmail: username@example.com
    customerName: Example Customer
    dockerconfigjson: eyJhdXRocyI6eyJd1dIRk5NbEZFVGsxd2JGUmFhWGxYWm5scloyNVRSV1pPT2pKT2NGaHhUVEpSUkU1...
    licenseFields:
      expires_at:
        description: License Expiration
        name: expires_at
        signature:
          v1: iZBpESXx7fpdtnbMKingYHiJH42rP8fPs0x8izy1mODckGBwVoA... 
        title: Expiration
        value: "2023-05-30T00:00:00Z"
        valueType: String
    licenseID: YiIXRTjiB7R...
    licenseType: dev
```

## `global.replicated` Values Schema

The `global.replicated` values schema contains the following fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `channelName` | String | The name of the release channel |
| `customerEmail` | String | The email address of the customer |
| `customerName` | String | The name of the customer |
| `dockerconfigjson` | String | Base64 encoded docker config json for pulling images |
| `licenseFields`| | A list containing each license field in the customer's license. Each element under `licenseFields` has the following properties: `description`, `signature`, `title`, `value`, `valueType`. `expires_at` is the default `licenseField` that all licenses include. Other elements under `licenseField` include the custom license fields added by vendors in the Vendor Portal. For more information, see [Manage Customer License Fields](/vendor/licenses-adding-custom-fields). |
| `licenseFields.[FIELD_NAME].description` | String | Description of the license field |
| `licenseFields.[FIELD_NAME].signature.v1` | Object | Signature of the license field |
| `licenseFields.[FIELD_NAME].title` | String | Title of the license field |
| `licenseFields.[FIELD_NAME].value` | String | Value of the license field |
| `licenseFields.[FIELD_NAME].valueType` | String | Type of the license field value |
| `licenseID` | String | The unique identifier for the license |
| `licenseType` | String | The type of license, such as "dev" or "prod". For more information, see [Customer Types](/vendor/licenses-about#customer-types) in _About Customers and Licensing_. |
