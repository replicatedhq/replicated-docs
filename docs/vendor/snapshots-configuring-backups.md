# Configure Snapshots

This topic provides information about how to configure the Velero Backup resource to enable Replicated KOTS snapshots for an application.

For more information about snapshots, see [About Backup and Restore with snapshots](/vendor/snapshots-overview).

## Configure Snapshots

Add a Velero Backup custom resource (`kind: Backup`, `apiVersion: velero.io/v1`) to your release and configure it as needed. After configuring the Backup resource, add annotations for each volume that you want to be included in backups.

To configure snapshots for your application:

1. In a new release containing your application files, add a Velero Backup resource (`kind: Backup` and `apiVersion: velero.io/v1`):

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: velero.io/v1
    kind: Backup
    metadata:
      name: backup
    spec: {}
    ```

1. Configure the Backup resource to specify the resources that will be included in backups.

    For more information about the Velero Backup resource, including limitations, the list of supported fields for snapshots, and an example, see [Velero Backup Resource for Snapshots](/reference/custom-resource-backup).

1. (Optional) Configure backup and restore hooks. For more information, see [Configure Backup and Restore Hooks for Snapshots](snapshots-hooks).

1. For each volume that requires a backup, add the `backup.velero.io/backup-volumes` annotation. The annotation name is `backup.velero.io/backup-volumes` and the value is a comma separated list of volumes to include in the backup.

   <details>
    <summary>Why do I need to use the backup annotation?</summary>
    <p>By default, no volumes are included in the backup. If any pods mount a volume that should be backed up, you must configure the backup with an annotation listing the specific volumes to include in the backup.</p>
   </details>

   **Example:**

   In the following Deployment manifest file, `pvc-volume` is the only volume that is backed up. The `scratch` volume is not included in the backup because it is not listed in annotation on the pod specification.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: sample
      labels:
        app: foo
    spec:
      replicas: 1
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: foo
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: foo
          annotations:
            backup.velero.io/backup-volumes: pvc-volume
        spec:
          containers:
          - image: k8s.gcr.io/test-webserver
            name: test-webserver
            volumeMounts:
            - name: pvc-volume
              mountPath: /volume-1
            - name: scratch
              mountPath: /volume-2
          volumes:
          - name: pvc-volume
            persistentVolumeClaim:
              claimName: test-volume-claim
          - name: scratch
            emptyDir: {}

    ```

1. (Optional) Configure manifest exclusions. By default, Velero also includes backups of all of the Kubernetes objects in the namespace.

    To exclude any manifest file, add a [`velero.io/exclude-from-backup=true`](https://velero.io/docs/v1.5/resource-filtering/#veleroioexclude-from-backuptrue) label to the manifest to be excluded. The following example shows the Secret manifest file with the `velero.io/exclude-from-backup` label:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: sample
      labels:
        velero.io/exclude-from-backup: "true"
    stringData:
      uri: Secret To Not Include

    ```

1. If you distribute multiple applications with Replicated, repeat these steps for each application. Each application must have its own Backup resource to be included in a full backup with snapshots.

1. (kURL Only) If your application supports installation with Replicated kURL, Replicated recommends that you include the kURL Velero add-on so that customers do not have to manually install Velero in the kURL cluster. For more information, see [Create a kURL Installer](packaging-embedded-kubernetes).
