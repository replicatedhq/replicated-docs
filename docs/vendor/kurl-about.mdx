## Overview

### kURL Installers

<Installers/>

To distribute a kURL installer alongside your application, you can promote the installer to a channel or include the installer as a manifest file within a given release. For more information about creating kURL installers, see [Create a kURL Installer](/vendor/packaging-embedded-kubernetes).

### kURL Installations

To install with kURL, users run a kURL installation script on their VM or bare metal server to provision a cluster.

When the KOTS add-on is included in the kURL installer spec, the kURL installation script installs the KOTS CLI and KOTS Admin Console in the cluster. After the installation script completes, users can access the Admin Console at the URL provided in the ouput of the command to configure and deploy the application with KOTS.

The following shows an example of the output of the kURL installation script:

```bash
        Installation
          Complete âœ”

Kotsadm: http://10.128.0.35:8800
Login with password (will not be shown again): 3Hy8WYYid

This password has been set for you by default. It is recommended that you change
this password; this can be done with the following command:
kubectl kots reset-password default
```

kURL installations are supported in online (internet-connected) and air gapped environments.

For information about how to install applications with kURL, see [Online Installation with kURL](/enterprise/installing-kurl).

## About the Open Source kURL Documentation

The open source kURL documentation contains additional information including kURL installation options, kURL add-ons, and procedural content such as how to add and manage nodes in kURL clusters.
