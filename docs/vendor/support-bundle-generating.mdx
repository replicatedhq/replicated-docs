# Generating Support Bundles

This topic describes how to generate support bundles from the command line using the kubectl support-bundle plugin. For more information about support bundles, see [About Preflights and Support Bundles](/vendor/preflight-support-bundle-about).

The information in this topic applies to generating support bundles in clusters where you have kubectl access. For information about generating support bundles that include cluster- and host-level information for Replicated Embedded Cluster installations, see [Generating Support Bundles for Embedded Cluster](support-bundle-embedded). 

## Prerequisite: Install the support-bundle Plugin

<InstallPlugin/>

## Generate a Bundle

<GenerateBundle/>

## Generate a Bundle when a Helm Installation Fails

If a Helm installation fails and you want to collect a support bundle to assist with diagnostics, you can use a Replicated default specification to generate the support bundle.

Run the following command:

```bash
kubectl support-bundle https://raw.githubusercontent.com/replicatedhq/troubleshoot-specs/main/in-cluster/default.yaml
```
