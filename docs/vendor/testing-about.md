# About the Compatibility Matrix (Beta)

This topic describes the Replicated compatibility matrix feature and use cases for testing applications in customer-representative environments.

:::note
The compatibility matrix add-on requires the purchase of credits at an additional cost. For more information, see [Prerequisites](testing-how-to#prerequisites) in _Using the Compatibility Matrix_.	The compatibility matrix add-on is Beta. The features, limitations, and requirements of the compatibility matrix are subject to change. As the compatiblity matrix add-on progresses towards general availability, many of its limitations will be removed.

## Overview

<Overview/>

You can use the compatibility matrix with the replicated CLI or the Replicated vendor portal. For more information about how to use the compatibility matrix, see [Using the Compatibility Matrix](testing-how-to).

## Cluster Status

Clusters created with the compatibility matrix can have the following statuses:

* `assigned`: The cluster resources were requested and the compatiblity matrix is provisioning the cluster. You are not billed for the time that a cluster spends in the `assigned` status.

* `running`: A working kubeconfig for the cluster is accessible. Billing begins when the cluster reaches a `running` status.

   Additionally, OpenShift, Kind, K3s, kURL and HelmVM clusters are verified prior to transitioning to a `running` status. Verification includes checking that the cluster is healthy and running with the correct number of nodes, as well as passing [sonobuoy](https://sonobuoy.io/) tests in `--quick` mode.

* `terminated`: The cluster is deleted. Billing ends when the cluster status is changed from `running` to `terminated`.

* `error`: An error occured when attempting to provision the cluster.

You can view the status of clusters using the `replicated cluster ls` command. For more information, see [cluster ls](/reference/replicated-cli-cluster-ls).
