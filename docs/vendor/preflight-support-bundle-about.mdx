# About Preflight Checks and Support Bundles

This topic provides an introduction to preflight checks and support bundles, which are provided by the Troubleshoot open source project.

For more information, see the [Troubleshoot](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/collect/) documentation.

## Overview

<Overview/>

Preflight checks and support bundles consist of _collectors_, _redactors_, and _analyzers_ that are defined in a YAML specification. When preflight checks or support bundles are executed, data is collected, redacted, then analyzed to provide insights to users, as illustrated in the following diagram:

For more information about each step in this workflow, see the sections below.

### Collect

During the collection phase, _collectors_ gather information from the cluster, the environment, the application, and other sources.

The data collected depends on the types of collectors that are included in the preflight or support bundle specification. For example, the Troubleshoot project provides collectors that can gather information about the Kubernetes version that is running in the cluster, information about database servers, logs from pods, and more.

For more information, see the [Collect](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/collect/) section in the Troubleshoot documentation.

### Redact

During the redact phase, _redactors_ censor sensitive customer information from the data before analysis. By default, the following information is automatically redacted:

- Passwords
- API token environment variables in JSON
- AWS credentials
- Database connection strings
- URLs that include usernames and passwords

For Replicated KOTS and Embedded Cluster installations, it is also possible to add custom redactors to redact additional data. For more information, see the [Redact](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/redact/) section in the Troubleshoot documentation.

### Analyze

During the analyze phase, _analyzers_ use the redacted data to provide insights to users.

For preflight checks, analyzers define the pass, fail, and warning outcomes, and can also display custom messages to the user. For example, you can define a preflight check that fails if the cluster's Kubernetes version does not meet the minimum version that your application supports.

For support bundles, analyzers can be used to identify potential problems and share relevant troubleshooting guidance with users. Additionally, when a support bundle is uploaded to the Vendor Portal, it is extracted and automatically analyzed. The goal of analyzers in support bundles is to surface known issues or hints of what might be a problem to make troubleshooting easier.

For more information, see the [Analyze](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/analyze/) section in the Troubleshoot documentation.

## Preflight Checks


This section provides an overview of preflight checks, including how preflights are defined and run.

### Overview

Preflight checks let you define requirements for the cluster where your application is installed. When run, preflight checks provide clear feedback to your customer about any missing requirements or incompatibilities in the cluster before they install or upgrade your application. For KOTS installations, preflight checks can also be used to block the deployment of the application if one or more requirements are not met.

Thorough preflight checks provide increased confidence that an installation or upgrade will succeed and help prevent support escalations.

### About Host Preflights {#host-preflights}

_Host preflight checks_ automatically run during [Replicated Embedded Cluster](/vendor/embedded-overview) and [Replicated kURL](/vendor/kurl-about) installations on a VM or bare metal server. The purpose of host preflight checks is to verify that the user's installation environment meets the requirements of the Embedded Cluster or kURL installer, such as checking the number of CPU cores in the system, available disk space, and memory usage. If any of the host preflight checks fail, installation is blocked and a message describing the failure is displayed.

Host preflight checks are separate from any application-specific preflight checks that are defined in the release, which run in the Admin Console before the application is deployed with KOTS. Both Embedded Cluster and kURL have default host preflight checks that are specific to the requirements of the given installer. For kURL installations, it is possible to customize the default host preflight checks.

For more information about the default Embedded Cluster host preflight checks, see [Host Preflight Checks](/vendor/embedded-using#about-host-preflight-checks) in _Using Embedded Cluster_.

For more information about kURL host preflight checks, including information about how to customize the defaults, see [Customize Host Preflight Checks for kURL](/vendor/preflight-host-preflights).

### Defining Preflights

To add preflight checks for your application, create a Preflight YAML specification that defines the collectors and analyzers that you want to include.

For information about how to add preflight checks to your application, including examples, see [Define Preflight Checks](preflight-defining).

### Blocking Installation with Required (Strict) Preflights

For applications installed with KOTS or Embedded Cluster, it is possible to block the deployment of a release if a preflight check fails. This is helpful when it is necessary to prevent an installation or upgrade from continuing unless a given requirement is met.

You can add required preflight checks for an application by including `strict: true` for the target analyzer in the preflight specification. For more information, see [Block Installation with Required (Strict) Preflights](preflight-defining#strict) in _Define Preflight Checks_.

### Running Preflights

This section describes how users can run preflight checks for KOTS and Helm installations.

#### Replicated Installations

For Replicated installations with Embedded Cluster, KOTS, or kURL, preflight checks run automatically as part of the installation process. The results of the preflight checks are displayed either in the KOTS Admin Console or in the KOTS CLI, depending on the installation method.

Additionally, users can access preflight checks from the Admin Console after installation to view their results and optionally re-run the checks.

The following shows an example of the results of preflight checks displayed in the Admin Console during installation:

#### Helm Installations

For installations with Helm, the preflight kubectl plugin is required to run preflight checks. The preflight plugin is a client-side utility that adds a single binary to the path. For more information, see [Getting Started](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/) in the Troubleshoot documentation.

Users can optionally run preflight checks before they run `helm install`. The results of the preflight checks are then displayed through the CLI, as shown in the example below:

For more information, see [Run Preflight Checks for Helm Installations](preflight-running).

## Support Bundles

This section provides an overview of support bundles, including how support bundles are customized and generated.

### Overview

A support bundle is a valuable diagnostic tool that collects and analyzes key troubleshooting data from the customer deployment to enable the end user to self-diagnose and resolve, and when escalating is necessary, it provides the supoprt teams with key necessary information upfront, reducing overall issue resolution time. Replicated has found that Severity 1 issues are resolved three times faster when a support bundle is provided during an issue escalation. 

The data collected in a support bundle depends on the collectors and redactors defined by the Vendor in the support bundle specification included with the application release. See [Customizing Support Bundles](/vendor/preflight-support-bundle-about#customizing-support-bundles) for more information.

When a support bundle is generated the process collects defined data from the cluster, redacts sensitive fields, and then perform analysis on the data to provide remediation steps. The output is a compressed tar.gz file that can be subsequently shared during a support escalation. No data is shared outside the cluster unless the resulting tar.gz file is explicitly shared by the end customer. See [Generating and Sharing Support Bundles](/vendor/preflight-support-bundle-about#generating-and-sharing-support-bundles) for more information.

Support bundles can collect a variety of important cluster-level data from customer environments, such as:
* Pod logs
* Node resources and status
* The status of replicas in a Deployment
* Cluster information
* Resources deployed to the cluster
* The history of Helm releases installed in the cluster

Support bundles can also be used for more advanced use cases, such as checking that a command successfully executes in a pod in the cluster, or that an HTTP request returns a succesful response.

See [Redact](/vendor/preflight-support-bundle-about#redact) for automatic redactions in generated support bundles. 

### About Host Support Bundles

For installations on VMs or bare metal servers with [Replicated Embedded Cluster](/vendor/embedded-overview) or [Replicated kURL](/vendor/kurl-about), it is possible to generate a support bundle that includes host-level information to help troubleshoot failures related to host configuration like DNS, networking, or storage problems.

For Embedded Cluster installations, a default spec can be used to generate support bundles that include cluster- and host-level information. See [Generate Host Bundles for Embedded Cluster](/vendor/support-bundle-embedded).

For kURL installations, vendors can customize a host support bundle spec for their application. See [Generate Host Bundles for kURL](/vendor/support-host-support-bundles).

### Customizing Support Bundles

To enable support bundles for your application, add a support bundle YAML specification to a release. An empty support bundle specification automatically includes several default collectors and analzyers. You can also optionally customize the support bundle specification for by adding, removing, or editing collectors and analyzers.

For more information, see [Add and Customize Support Bundles](support-bundle-customizing).

### Generating and Sharing Support Bundles

Users generate support bundles as `tar.gz` files from the command line using the support-bundle kubectl plugin, or via the KOTS Admin Console. Your customers can then share their support bundles with your team by sending you the resulting `tar.gz` file.

Your customer has multiple options to provide you with the generated support bundle. We recommend adivising your customer to use one of the following methods:
* Directly upload their support bundles via their Enterprise Portal. Using this method additionally gives the customer control to download and delete their own bundles. For more information see [Upload and Manage Support Bundles](/vendor/enterprise-portal-use#collect-upload-and-manage-support-bundles). 
* KOTS and Embedded Cluster users can also share support bundles from the KOTS Admin Console once generated. For more information, see [Generate Support Bundles](support-bundle-generating).

By providing the support bundle via one of the above methods, the file and its comprehensive analysis results are directly available within the Vendor Portal, saving you the step of of manually uploading the provided file for the purpose of analaysis or sharing with Replicated Support. 

The Support Bundle Analysis page includes:
* Analysis Overview: Filterable view showing errors, warnings, and insights
* Instance Reporting Data: Point-in-time information about the instance
* File Inspector: Directory tree browser for examining collected files
* Download Option: Ability to download the bundle for offline analysis

Vendors have direct control of uploaded support bundles, including sharing with Replicated or deleting previously uploaded bundles. 

When uploaded to Vendor Poral, support bundles are stored per Replicated's data and security standards. See [Security at Replicated](https://www.replicated.com/security) for more information.

### Sharing Support Bundles with Replicated

Replicated strongly recommends that you always provide a support bundle when you open a new support request, and that you attach new bundles to an existing support issue when conditions change or new problems arise. Sharing an existing support bundle or uploading a new one is secure and provides the Replicated Support team immediate access to necessary diagnostic data, enabling them to provide faster and more informed assistance in troubleshooting your application. 

See [Submit a Support Request](/vendor/support-submit-request) for more information.
