# Community Licenses

This topic describes community licenses. For more information about other types of licenses, see [License Types](licenses-about#license-types) in _About Customers_.

## Overview

Community licenses are intended for use with a free or low cost version of your application. For example, you could use community licenses for an open source version of your application.

After installing an application with a community license, users can replace their community license with a new license file of a different type without having to completely reinstall the application. This means that, if you have several community users who install with the same license, then you can upgrade a single community user without editing the license for all community users.

Community license users can upload a new license file in the admin console. Upgrading from a community license cannot be reverted. For more information, see [Upgrade from a Community License](/enterprise/updating-licenses#upgrade-from-a-community-license) in _Updating Licenses_. 

## Limitations

Community licenses function in the same way as the other types of licenses, with the following
exceptions:

* Updating a community license to another type of license cannot be reverted.
* Community license users are not supported by the Replicated Support team.
* Community licenses cannot support air gapped installations.
* Community licenses cannot include an expiration date.
* For applications installed with Replicated KOTS, the branding in the Replicated admin console for community users differs in the following ways:
  * The license tile on the admin console **Dashboard** page is highlighted in yellow and with the words **Community Edition**.
