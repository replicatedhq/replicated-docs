## Overview of Using Private Registries

Using an external private image registry or the Replicated private registry for your application requires an image pull secret for access. The unique license for each customer can grant access to the Replicated private registry, or grant proxy access to an external registry without exposing registry credentials to the customer. When the app manager installs an application, Replicated automatically uses the customer license to create and inject an image pull secret.

In addition to the image pull secret, using an external private registry also requires that you add credentials for the registry to the vendor portal so that Replicated can access the image through the Replicated proxy service. For kots CLI and Kubernetes installer installations, Replicated automatically patches the image name to reference the location of the image on the proxy service at `proxy.replicated.com`. For more information about this process, see [How the App Manager Accesses Private Images](packaging-private-images#how-the-app-manager-accesses-private-images) in _Connecting to an Image Registry_.

For installations that use the helm CLI rather than the app manager, Replicated cannot automatically inject an image pull secret nor patch the image name to reference the proxy service in the Helm chart for your application.

To use private images with your application for helm CLI installations, use Helm's template functions to inject an image pull secret into the Helm chart. If you are using an external private registry, you must also update references to the image name in your Helm chart to use the location of the image on the Replicated proxy service.

For more information, see [Deliver Image Pull Secrets for a Private Registry](#pull-secret) and [Update the Image Name to Reference the Proxy Service](#proxy-service) below.

## Deliver Image Pull Secrets for a Private Registry {#pull-secret}

To inject an image pull secret for an external private registry or the Replicated private registry, first add the Replicated `LicenseDockerCfg` template function to the Helm chart `values.yaml` file. The `LicenseDockerCfg` template function renders a value based on the unique customer license when the Helm chart is pulled. Write this rendered value to a pull secret, then reference the pull secret in the necessary template files for the Helm chart.

For more information about the `LicenseDockerCfg` template function, see [LicenseDockerCfg](/reference/template-functions-license-context#licensedockercfg) in _License Context_.

To deliver customer-specific image pull secrets for a private registry:

1. Add the `LicenseDockerCfg` template function to a field in the Helm chart `values.yaml` file using the following format:

   ```yaml
   FIELD_NAME: "repl{{ LicenseDockerCfg }}"
   ```
   Replace `FIELD_NAME` with any name for the field. You can add `"repl{{ LicenseDockerCfg }}"` as a flat or nested value. For more information, see [Flat or Nested Values](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_best_practices/values/#flat-or-nested-values) in the Helm documentation.

   **Example:**

   ```yaml
   images:
     pullSecrets:
       replicated:
         dockerconfigjson: "repl{{ LicenseDockerCfg }}"
   ```   

1. In the `templates` directory of your Helm chart, create a Kubernetes Secret manifest file (`kind: Secret`). Add the following YAML to the file to evaluate if the secret value is set, and then write the rendered value into a Secret on the cluster:

   ```yaml
   {{ if .Values.FIELD_NAME }}
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   metadata:
     name: SECRET_NAME
   # Kubernetes clusters use the kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson Secret type
   # to authenticate with a private image registry.
   type: kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
   data:
     .dockerconfigjson: {{ .Values.FIELD_NAME }}
   {{ end }}
   ```

   Replace:
   * `FIELD_NAME` with the name of the field from the previous step where you added `"repl{{ LicenseDockerCfg }}"`. For example, `.Values.images.pullSecrets.replicated.dockerconfigjson`.
   * `SECRET_NAME` with any name for the secret. For example, `replicated`.

   **Example:**

   ```yaml
   {{ if .Values.images.pullSecrets.replicated.dockerconfigjson }}
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   metadata:
     name: replicated
   type: kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
   data:
     .dockerconfigjson: {{ .Values.images.pullSecrets.replicated.dockerconfigjson }}
   {{ end }}
   ```

1. Add the following to any manifests in the Helm chart `templates` directory that reference private images, to inject the pull secret that you created in the previous step:

   ```yaml
        ...
        {{ if .Values.FIELD_NAME }}
        imagePullSecrets:
          - name: SECRET_NAME
        {{ end }}
   ```
   Replace:
   * `FIELD_NAME` with the name of the field where you where you added `"repl{{ LicenseDockerCfg }}"`.
   * `SECRET_NAME` with the name of the Secret that you created in the previous step.

   **Example:**

   The following example shows the `imagePullSecrets` field in a `templates/deployment.yaml` file that also injects values for the image registry URL, image tag, and `imagePullPolicy`.

    ```yaml
        ...
        image: {{ .Values.images.myapp.repository }}{{ .Values.images.myapp.tag }}
        imagePullPolicy: {{ .Values.images.myapp.pullPolicy }}
        {{ if .Values.images.pullSecrets.replicated.dockerconfigjson }}
        imagePullSecrets:
          - name: replicated
        {{ end }}
        name: myapp
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3000
          name: http
    ```

1. Package your Helm chart and add the packaged chart to a release in the Replicated vendor portal. For more information, see [Add a Helm Chart to a Release](helm-release#add-a-helm-chart-to-a-release).
   :::note
   If you are using an external private registry, ensure that you also complete the steps in [Update the Image Name to Reference the Proxy Service](#proxy-service) below. Otherwise, Replicated will not be able to access your private image through the proxy service.
   :::

1. Save and promote the release to a development environment to test your changes.  

## Update the Image Name to Reference the Proxy Service {#proxy-service}

If you are using an external private registry, you must update the location of the private image in the Helm chart to reference the Replicated proxy service at `proxy.replicated.com`. This, along with the customer-specific image pull secret, allows Replicated to access the private image for your application during Helm Install installations.

To reference the proxy service, first create a field in the Helm chart `values.yaml` file with the URL of the location of the private image on `proxy.replicated.com`. Use template functions to reference this field from the Pod spec in the Helm chart. This allows Replicated to access the external registry through the proxy service when your users install with the helm CLI.

Then, update the Replicated HelmChart custom resource manifest file with the URL for the image on your external registry. Adding this URL to the HelmChart custom resource ensures that the Replicated proxy service can automatically patch the image name to reference `proxy.replicated.com` during KOTS Install or Embedded Cluster installations.

:::note
This procedure is not required if you are using the Replicated private registry.
:::

To update the image name to reference the proxy service:

1. Create a field in the Helm chart `values.yaml` file with the location of the private image on `proxy.replicated.com`:

   ```yaml
   FIELD_NAME: PROXY_SERVICE_IMAGE_URL
   ```
   Replace:
   * `FIELD_NAME` with any name for the field.
   * `PROXY_SERVICE_IMAGE_URL` with the URL for the private image on `proxy.replicated.com`. Helm Install installations use this proxy service URL that you add to the `values.yaml` file.

      The proxy service URL uses the following format: `proxy.replicated.com/proxy/APP_NAME/EXTERNAL_REGISTRY_IMAGE_URL`, where `APP_NAME` is the name of your application and `EXTERNAL_REGISTRY_IMAGE_URL` is the path to the private image on your external registry.

   **Example:**

   ```yaml
   apiImageRepository: proxy.replicated.com/proxy/my-kots-app/quay.io/my-org/api
   apiImageTag: v1.0.1
   ```  
   The example above shows a field for the image name and a separate field for the image tag.

1. In any manifest files in your Helm chart that reference the proxied image, set the image name to the field that you created in the `values.yaml` file in the previous step. This ensures that Helm Install installations use the proxy service URL from the `values.yaml` file for the location of the private image.

   Use the following Helm template function format:

   ```yaml
   image: '{{ .Values.FIELD_NAME }}'
   ```

   **Example:**

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
    name: example
   spec:
     template:
       spec:
         containers:
           - name: api
             image: '{{ .Values.apiImageRepository }}:{{ .Values.apiImageTag }}'
   ```

   The example above shows how to reference both the `apiImageRepository` and `apiImageTag` fields from the previous example.

1. Package your Helm chart and add the packaged chart to a release in the Replicated vendor portal. For more information, see [Add a Helm Chart to a Release](helm-release#add-a-helm-chart-to-a-release).

1. In the release, create or open the HelmChart custom resource manifest file. A HelmChart custom resource manifest file has `kind: HelmChart` and `apiVersion: kots.io/v1beta1`.

   **Template:**

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: kots.io/v1beta1
   kind: HelmChart
   metadata:
     name: samplechart
   spec:
     ...
   ```

   The Replicated HelmChart custom resource allows Replicated to process and deploy Helm charts. For more information, see [HelmChart](/reference/custom-resource-helmchart) in the _References_ section.

1. Under the HelmChart custom resource `values` field, create a new field and add a static key value pair with the location of the private image on the external registry:

   ```yaml
   values:
     FIELD_NAME: REGISTRY_URL
   ```
   Replace:
   * `FIELD_NAME` with the same field name that you created in the previous step in the `values.yaml` file. For example, `apiImageRepository`.
   * `REGISTRY_URL` with the URL for the image on your external registry.

      KOTS Install and Embedded Cluster installations use this static value from HelmChart custom resource for the registry URL. This allows the Replicated proxy service to automatically patch the image name to reference `proxy.replicated.com` for KOTS Install and Embedded Cluster installations.

      Helm Install installations ignore this static value, and instead use the `proxy.replicated.com` URL that you added to the `values.yaml` file in a previous step.

   **Example:**

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: kots.io/v1beta1
   kind: HelmChart
   metadata:
     name: samplechart
   spec:
     chart:
       name: samplechart
       chartVersion: 3.1.7
       releaseName: samplechart-release-v1
     values:
       apiImageRepository: quay.io/my-org/api:v1.0.1
   ```

1. Save and promote the release to a development environment to test your changes.
