# Install SlackerNews with the Helm CLI

This topic provides a tutorial that demonstrates how to install a sample application using the Helm CLI.

## Introduction

This tutorial shows how to install a Helm chart distributed with Replicated using the Helm CLI.

In this tutorial, you will:

* Download the Helm chart for the sample application (SlackerNews)

* Create a release for SlackerNews in the Replicated Platform

* Get the Helm CLI installation instructions for SlackerNews from the Replicated Enterprise Portal 

* Install SlackerNews using the Helm CLI in a Kubernetes cluster

## Set Up Your Environment

Before you begin, do the following to set up your environment:

* Install the Helm CLI, which is the tool for interacting with Helm and managing Helm charts. See [Install Helm](/vendor/environment-setup#install-helm).

* Ensure that you have access to a cluster that meets the requirements for Embedded Cluster:

   * **Option 1: Use Compatibility Matrix.** To use Replicated Compatibility Matrix to create a cluster for this tutorial, first request Compatibility Matrix credits. You can request credits by creating a Vendor Portal account and then going to [**Compatibility Matrix > Request more credits**](https://vendor.replicated.com/compatibility-matrix) in the Vendor Portal. For more information about creating an account, see [Create a Vendor Account](vendor-portal-creating-account). For more information about Compatibility Matrix credits, see [Billing and Credits](/vendor/testing-about#billing-and-credits).

          :::note
          If you are new to the Replicated platform, you might be eligible for $100 in free Compatibility Matrix credits. To request your free credits, reach out to our sales team at https://www.replicated.com/contact and note in the comments that you are completing a Replicated tutorial.
          :::

      After you complete the prerequisites above, continue to the [Tutorial](#tutorial). You will create the cluster with Compatibility Matrix as part of the tutorial.

   * **Option 2: Bring your own Cluster.**

   For more information, see [Set Up Development Environments for Testing](/vendor/environment-setup#dev).

## Tutorial

1. Create an application using the Replicated CLI:

    1. On your local machine, install the Replicated CLI:

       * MacOS

         ```bash
         brew install replicatedhq/replicated/cli
         ```
       * Linux / Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

         ```bash
         version=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/replicatedhq/replicated/releases/latest \
           | grep -m1 -Po '"tag_name":\s*"v\K[^"]+')
         curl -Ls \
           "https://github.com/replicatedhq/replicated/releases/download/v${version}/replicated_${version}_linux_amd64.tar.gz" \
           -o replicated.tar.gz
         tar xf replicated.tar.gz replicated && rm replicated.tar.gz
         mv replicated /usr/local/bin/replicated
         ``` 
       For more information and additional installation options, see [Install the Replicated CLI](/reference/replicated-cli-installing).

    1. Authorize the Replicated CLI:

       ```bash
       replicated login
       ```
       In the browser window that opens, follow the prompt to log in to your Vendor Portal account and authorize the CLI.

   1. Create an application named `SlackerNews`:

       ```bash
       replicated app create SlackerNews
       ```

   1. Set the `REPLICATED_APP` environment variable to the application that you created:

       ```bash
       export REPLICATED_APP=APP_SLUG
       ```
       Where `APP_SLUG` is the unique application slug provided in the output of the `app create` command.

       Setting the `REPLICATED_APP` environment variable allows you to interact with the application using the Replicated CLI without needing to use the `--app` flag with every command.

### Get the Chart Archive and Create a Release       

1. Run the following command to download the SlackerNews Helm chart archive to a new `tutorial-helm-install` directory: 

    ```
    curl -O --create-dirs --output-dir tutorial-helm-install https://docs.replicated.com/slackernews-1.0.1.tgz
    ```

1. Add the chart archive to a new release:

   ```bash
   replicated release create --yaml-dir tutorial-helm-install --promote Unstable
   ```
   **Example output:**
   ```
   • Reading manifests from . ✓
   • Creating Release ✓
    • SEQUENCE: 1
   • Promoting ✓
    • Channel 32q8tKLfRFbHYPGJ1Q2E2vcDQ9j successfully set to release 1
   ```

### Create a Customer

1. Log in to the [Vendor Portal](https://vendor.replicated.com).

1. Under the application drop down, select the SlackerNews application that you created.

1. For instance name, enter a nickname for the instance.

1. For **Kubernetes Distribution**, select the distribution of your cluster where you will install SlackerNews. (If you are going to use Compatibility Matrix to create the cluster, select **Vanilla Kubernetes**).

1. For **Cluster Network Availability**, select **Outbound requests allowed**.

1. For **Registry Access**, select **My workstation can access the internet, the registry AND the cluster**.

1. Click **Next**.

### Install    

1. If you brouhgt your own cluster, set kubectl context to the cluster where you want to install. If you are using Compatibility Matrix, do the following:

   1. Create a kind cluster with version 1.34.0 of Kubernetes:

      ```bash
      replicated cluster create --distribution kind --instance-type r1.small --disk 50 --version 1.34.0
      ```

   1. After the cluster is running, use the kubectl command provided to set your kubectl context to the cluster.

1. In the Enterprise Portal, for **Helm Online Install**, select the release version that you promoted (`1.0.1`).

1. Run the first command to log in to the Replicated registry.

1. Run the commands to install the preflight plugin and then run preflight checks in the cluster.

1. Copy the install command and make the following changes:
   * Remove the `--values my-values.yaml` flag. This is not necessary for the purpose of this tutorial because you do not need to pass a local values file to the chart.
   * Add `--namespace slackernews --create-namespace` to install the application to the slackernews namespace on the cluster

1. Watch the application resources become available: 

    ```bash
    kubectl get all --namespace slackernews --watch
    ```

1. Run the following command to port forward the slackernews NGINX service to local port 8080:

   ```bash
   kubectl port-forward --namespace slackernews svc/slackernews-nginx 8080:8080
   ``` 

1. Open `localhost:8080` in a browser to view the SlackerNews application and confirm that the installation was successful.
