# Install SlackerNews with the Helm CLI

This topic provides a tutorial that demonstrates how to install a sample application using the Helm CLI.

## Introduction

This tutorial shows how to install a Helm chart distributed with Replicated using the Helm CLI.

In this tutorial, you will:

* Download the Helm chart for the sample application (SlackerNews)

* Create a release for SlackerNews in the Replicated Platform

* Get the Helm CLI installation instructions for SlackerNews from the Replicated Enterprise Portal 

* Install SlackerNews using the Helm CLI in a Kubernetes cluster

## Set Up Your Environment

Before you begin, do the following to set up your environment:

* Install the Helm CLI, which is the tool for interacting with Helm and managing Helm charts. See [Install Helm](/vendor/environment-setup#install-helm).

* Ensure that you have access to a cluster that meets the requirements for Embedded Cluster:

   * **Option 1: Use Compatibility Matrix.** To use Replicated Compatibility Matrix to create a cluster for this tutorial, first request Compatibility Matrix credits. You can request credits by creating a Vendor Portal account and then going to [**Compatibility Matrix > Request more credits**](https://vendor.replicated.com/compatibility-matrix) in the Vendor Portal. For more information about creating an account, see [Create a Vendor Account](vendor-portal-creating-account). For more information about Compatibility Matrix credits, see [Billing and Credits](/vendor/testing-about#billing-and-credits).

          :::note
          If you are new to the Replicated platform, you might be eligible for $100 in free Compatibility Matrix credits. To request your free credits, reach out to our sales team at https://www.replicated.com/contact and note in the comments that you are completing a Replicated tutorial.
          :::

      After you complete the prerequisites above, continue to the [Tutorial](#tutorial). You will create the cluster with Compatibility Matrix as part of the tutorial.

   * **Option 2: Bring your own Cluster.**

   For more information, see [Set Up Development Environments for Testing](/vendor/environment-setup#dev).

## Tutorial

1. Create an application using the Replicated CLI:

    1. On your local machine, install the Replicated CLI:

       * MacOS

         ```bash
         brew install replicatedhq/replicated/cli
         ```
       * Linux / Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

         ```bash
         version=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/replicatedhq/replicated/releases/latest \
           | grep -m1 -Po '"tag_name":\s*"v\K[^"]+')
         curl -Ls \
           "https://github.com/replicatedhq/replicated/releases/download/v${version}/replicated_${version}_linux_amd64.tar.gz" \
           -o replicated.tar.gz
         tar xf replicated.tar.gz replicated && rm replicated.tar.gz
         mv replicated /usr/local/bin/replicated
         ``` 
       For more information and additional installation options, see [Install the Replicated CLI](/reference/replicated-cli-installing).

    1. Authorize the Replicated CLI:

       ```bash
       replicated login
       ```
       In the browser window that opens, follow the prompt to log in to your Vendor Portal account and authorize the CLI.

   1. Create an application named `SlackerNews`:

       ```bash
       replicated app create SlackerNews
       ```

   1. Set the `REPLICATED_APP` environment variable to the application that you created:

       ```bash
       export REPLICATED_APP=APP_SLUG
       ```
       Where `APP_SLUG` is the unique application slug provided in the output of the `app create` command.

       Setting the `REPLICATED_APP` environment variable allows you to interact with the application using the Replicated CLI without needing to use the `--app` flag with every command.

## Get the Chart Archive and Create a Release       

1. Run the following command to download the SlackerNews Helm chart archive to a new `tutorial-helm-install` directory: 

    ```
    curl -O --create-dirs --output-dir tutorial-helm-install https://docs.replicated.com/slackernews-1.0.1.tgz
    ```

1. Add the chart to a new release with `replicated release create --yaml-dir tutorial-helm-install --promote Unstable`.

## Create a Customer

1. Log in to the [Vendor Portal](https://vendor.replicated.com).

1. Under the application drop down, select the SlackerNews application that you created.

1. For **Customer name**, enter a name for the customer. For example, `Example Customer`.

1. For **Assigned Channel**, select **Unstable**. This allows the customer to install releases promoted to the Unstable channel.

1. For **Customer type**, select **Development**.

1. For **Install types**, enable **Existing Cluster (Helm CLI)**.

1. Click **Save Changes**.

## Access the Enterprise Portal

1. On the customer's page, go to the **Enterprise Portal Access** tab.

1. Enable the **Enable Enterprise Portal for this customer** toggle.

## Create the Values File

1. Create a Helm values file to pass to the chart during installation:

    ```bash
    touch my-values.yaml
    ```
1. In the `my-values.yaml` file, copy and paste the following YAML:

        <details>
          <summary>View `my-values.yaml`</summary>
          ```yaml
          postgres:
            # tells slackernews to use postgres as the
            # backing database instead of sqlite
            enabled: false
            # deploys a postgresql workload to the cluster
            deploy_postgres: false
            # the password to use with deploy_postgres
            password: ""
            # if deploy_postgres is false, provide a URI
            uri: ""
            # use a value in an existing secret instead of
            # .postgres.password OR .postgres.uri
            existingSecretName: ""
            # key in the secret that contains the password
            existingSecretPasswordKey: ""

                tag: 16
                pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
          ```
        </details>

1. In the `slackernews.domain` field, enter a hostname.

    This is a required value for the application. For the purpose of this tutorial, the value that you provide does not need to be a real hostname. You will use a port forward to access SlackerNews in a browser after installation.

    ```yaml
    # my-values.yaml
    slackernews:
      domain: "somedomain"
    ```

## Install    

1. Set kubectl context to the cluster where you want to install. If you are using Compatibility Matrix, do the following:

    1. Create a kind cluster with version 1.34.0 of Kubernetes:

       ```bash
       replicated cluster create --distribution kind --instance-type r1.small --disk 50 --version 1.34.0
       ```

    1. After the cluster is running, use the kubectl command provided to set your kubectl context to the cluster.

1. In the Enterprise Portal, for **Helm Online Install**, select the release version that you promoted (`0.0.1`).

1. Copy and run the first command to log in to the Replicated registry.

1. Copy and run the commands to install and run preflight checks in the cluster.

1. Run the install command to install SlackerNews in your cluster using the Helm CLI. Ensure that the path provided with the `--values` flag points to the `my-values.yaml` file that you created.

1. Run `kubectl get all -n slackernews` to see when services are running

1. Run `kubectl port-forward --namespace slackernews svc/slackernews-nginx 8080:80` to port forward

1. Open `localhost:8080` in a browser.
