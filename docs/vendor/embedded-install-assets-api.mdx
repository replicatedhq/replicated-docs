# Serve Embedded Cluster Installation Assets Using the Vendor API

This topic describes how to serve the installation assets for Replicated Embedded Cluster using the Vendor API v3.

## Overview

To install with Embedded Cluster, you need to download the Embedded Cluster installer binary and a license. Air gap installations also require an air gap bundle. Some vendors already have a portal where their customers can log in to access documentation or download artifacts. In cases like this, you can serve the Embedded Cluster installation essets yourself using the Replicated Vendor API, rather than having customers download the assets from the Replicated app service using a curl command during installation.

## Serve Assets with the API

To serve Embedded Cluster installation assets with the Vendor API v3:

1. If you have not done so already, create an API token for the Vendor API. See [Using the Vendor API v3](/reference/vendor-api-using#api-token-requirement).

1. Call the [Get an Embedded Cluster release](https://replicated-vendor-api.readme.io/reference/getembeddedclusterrelease) endpoint to download the assets needed to install your application with Embedded Cluster. Your customers must take this binary and their license and copy them to the machine where they will install your application.

     Note the following:

     * (Recommended) Provide the `customerId` query parameter so that the customerâ€™s license is included in the downloaded tarball. This mirrors what is returned when a customer downloads the binary directly using the Replicated app service and is the most useful option. Excluding the `customerId` is useful if you plan to distribute the license separately.

     * If you do not provide any query parameters, this endpoint downloads the Embedded Cluster binary for the latest release on the specified channel. You can provide the `channelSequence` query parameter to download the binary for a particular release.
