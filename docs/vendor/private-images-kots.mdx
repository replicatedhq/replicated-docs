# Using the Proxy Service with KOTS Installations

This topic describes how to use the Replicated proxy service with applications deployed with Replicated KOTS.

## Overview

Replicated KOTS automatically creates the required image pull secret for accessing the Replicated proxy service during application deployment. When possible, KOTS also automatically rewrites image names in the application manifests to the location of the image at `proxy.replicated.com` or your custom domain.  

### Image Pull Secret

During application deployment, KOTS automatically creates an `imagePullSecret` with `type: kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson` that is based on the customer license. This secret is used to authenticate with the proxy registry and grant proxy access to private images.

For information about how Kubernetes uses the `kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson` Secret type to authenticate to a private image registry, see [Pull an Image from a Private Registry](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/) in the Kubernetes documentation.

### Image Location Patching (Standard Manifests and HelmChart v1)

For applications packaged with standard Kubernetes manifests (or Helm charts deployed with the [HelmChart v1](/reference/custom-resource-helmchart) custom resource), KOTS automatically patches image names to the location of the image at at `proxy.replicated.com` or your custom domain during deployment. If KOTS receives a 401 response when attempting to load image manifests using the image reference from the PodSpec, it assumes that this is a private image that must be proxied through the proxy service.

KOTS uses Kustomize to patch the `midstream/kustomization.yaml` file to change the image name during deployment to reference the proxy service. For example, a PodSpec for a Deployment references a private image hosted at `quay.io/my-org/api:v1.0.1`:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: api
          image: quay.io/my-org/api:v1.0.1
```

When this application is deployed, KOTS detects that it cannot access
the image at quay.io. So, it creates a patch in the `midstream/kustomization.yaml`
file that changes the image name in all manifest files for the application. This causes the container runtime in the cluster to use the proxy service to pull the images, using the license information provided to KOTS for authentication.

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
bases:
- ../../base
images:
- name: quay.io/my-org/api:v1.0.1
  newName: proxy.replicated.com/proxy/my-kots-app/quay.io/my-org/api
```

## Enable the Proxy Service

This section describes how to enable the proxy service for applications deployed with KOTS, including how to ensure that image names are rewritten and that the required image pull secret is provided.

To enable the proxy service:

1. Provide read-only credentials for the external private registry in your Replicated account. This allows Replicated to access the images through the proxy service. See [Add Credentials for an External Registry](packaging-private-images#add-credentials-for-an-external-registry) in _Connecting to an External Registry_.

1. (Optional) Add a custom domain for the proxy service instead of `proxy.replicated.com`. See [Using Custom Domains](custom-domains-using).

1. Rewrite images names to the location of the image at `proxy.replicated.com` or your custom domain. Also, ensure that the correct image pull secret is provided for all private images. The steps required to configure image names and add the image pull secret vary depending on your application type:

    * **HelmChart v2**: For Helm charts deployed with the[ HelmChart v2](/reference/custom-resource-helmchart-v2) custom resource, configure the HelmChart v2 custom resource to dynamically update image names in your Helm chart and to inject the image pull secret that is automatically created by KOTS. For instructions, see [Configuring the HelmChart Custom Resource v2](/vendor/helm-native-v2-using).

    * **Standard Manifests or HelmChart v1**: For standard manifest-based applications or Helm charts deployed with the [HelmChart v1](/reference/custom-resource-helmchart) custom resource, no additional configuration is required. KOTS automatically rewrites image names and injects image pull secrets during deployment for these application types.

    * **Pods Deployed to Additional Namespaces**: If you are deploying Pods to namespaces other than the application namespace, add the namespace to the `additionalNamespaces` attribute of the KOTS Application custom resource. This ensures that KOTS can provision the `imagePullSecret` in the namespace to allow the Pod to pull the image. For instructions, see [Defining Additional Namespaces](operator-defining-additional-namespaces).

    * **Kubernetes Operators**: For applications packaged with Kubernetes Operators, KOTS cannot modify pods that are created at runtime by the Operator. To support the use of private images in all environments, the Operator code should use KOTS functionality to determine the image name and image pull secrets for all pods when they are created. For instructions, see [Referencing Images](/vendor/operator-referencing-images) in the _Packaging Kubernetes Operators_ section.
