# Use the Proxy Registry with Replicated Installers

This topic describes how to use the Replicated proxy registry for applications deployed with Replicated installers (Embedded Cluster, KOTS existing cluster, or kURL). For more information about the proxy registry, see [About the Replicated Proxy Registry](private-images-about).

## Configure Your Application to Use the Proxy Registry

These steps assume that you package your application with Helm and that you install with the KOTS [HelmChart v2](/reference/custom-resource-helmchart-v2) custom resource.

If you are installing with the HelmChart v1 custom resource, or if your application is not packaged with Helm, there are different steps for configuring your application to use the proxy registry. See [Configure Other Application Types](#other) below.

To configure your application to use the proxy registry for installations with a Replicated installer:

1. <StepCreds/>

1. <StepCustomDomain/>

1. <RewriteHelmValues/>

1. <InjectPullSecret/>

1. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for each Helm chart used by your application.

1. <AdditionalNs/>

1. Create a new release with your changes. Promote the release to a development channel. See [Managing Releases with Vendor Portal](releases-creating-releases).

1. Install in a development environment to test your changes.

## Configure Other Application Types {#other}

If you are installing with the HelmChart v1 custom resource, or if your application is not packaged with Helm, there are different steps for configuring your application to use the proxy registry.

### HelmChart v1 or Standard Manifests

:::note

To use the proxy registry with HelmChart v1 or applications packaged with standard manifests:

1. <StepCreds/>

1. <StepCustomDomain/>

1. <AdditionalNs/>

1. Create a new release with your changes. Promote the release to a development channel. See [Managing Releases with Vendor Portal](releases-creating-releases).

1. Install in a development environment to test your changes.

For applications packed with Kubernetes manifests and for Helm charts deployed with the [HelmChart v1](/reference/custom-resource-helmchart) custom resource, KOTS automatically rewrites image names and injects image pull secrets during deployment for these application types. No additional configuration is required to rewrite image names.

<details>

<summary>How does KOTS patch image names?</summary>

KOTS automatically patches image names to the location of the image at at `proxy.replicated.com` or your custom domain during deployment. If KOTS receives a 401 response when attempting to load image manifests using the image reference from the PodSpec, it assumes that this is a private image that must be proxied through the proxy registry.

KOTS uses Kustomize to patch the `midstream/kustomization.yaml` file to change the image name during deployment to reference the proxy registry. For example, a PodSpec for a Deployment references a private image hosted at `quay.io/my-org/api:v1.0.1`:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: api
          image: quay.io/my-org/api:v1.0.1
```

When this application is deployed, KOTS detects that it cannot access
the image at quay.io. So, it creates a patch in the `midstream/kustomization.yaml`
file that changes the image name in all manifest files for the application. This causes the container runtime in the cluster to use the proxy registry to pull the images, using the license information provided to KOTS for authentication.

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
bases:
- ../../base
images:
- name: quay.io/my-org/api:v1.0.1
  newName: proxy.replicated.com/proxy/my-kots-app/quay.io/my-org/api
```
</details> 

### Kubernetes Operators

To use the proxy registry with applications packaged as Kubernetes Operators:

1. <StepCreds/>

1. <StepCustomDomain/>

1. <AdditionalNs/>

1. For applications packaged with Kubernetes Operators, KOTS cannot modify pods that are created at runtime by the Operator. To support the use of private images in all environments, the Operator code should use KOTS functionality to determine the image name and image pull secrets for all pods when they are created. For instructions, see [Reference Images](/vendor/operator-referencing-images) in the _Packaging Kubernetes Operators_ section.

1. Create a new release with your changes. Promote the release to a development channel. See [Managing Releases with Vendor Portal](releases-creating-releases).

1. Install in a development environment to test your changes.
