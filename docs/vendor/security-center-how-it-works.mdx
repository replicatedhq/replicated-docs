# How Security Center (Alpha) Works

This topic provides technical details about how Replicated Security Center generates CVE reports and SBOMs for your application releases.

## Overview

When you promote a release to a channel in Vendor Portal, Replicated automatically generates comprehensive security information for all container images in that release. Security Center uses Replicated's [SecureBuild](https://securebuild.com/) technology to continuously scan your images with industry-standard open-source tools—[Grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype) for CVE scanning and [Syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft) for SBOM generation.

## What Images Are Scanned?

The security scanning process analyzes all container images referenced in your release:

- **Container images in PodSpecs** - Any images defined in your Kubernetes manifests (Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets, etc.)
- **Additional images** - Images listed in the Application custom resource's `additionalImages` field
- **Embedded Cluster images** - Infrastructure images used by Embedded Cluster installations (if relevant)

## CVE Scanning

### How It Works

Replicated uses SecureBuild technology powered by [Grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype), an open-source vulnerability scanner. Unlike point-in-time scanning, Security Center scans your images continuously—not just when you promote a release. This means as new CVEs are disclosed, they automatically appear in your Security Center without requiring a new release.

### The Scanning Process

1. When you promote a release, Replicated identifies all container images in that release
2. SecureBuild pulls by digest and scans it with Grype. Scanning occurs for multiple architectures (amd64 and arm64) when relevant
3. Grype compares packages in the image against vulnerability databases (including NVD, OS-specific databases, and language-specific sources)
4. Vulnerability counts are aggregated by severity: Critical, High, Medium, and Low
5. Each CVE includes the identifier, description, CVSS score, affected artifacts, and available fixes
6. If a release associated image digest is updated, the associated release version SBOM will be regenerated, which will update calculated CVEs as well

### What You See

- **Vendor Portal** - Vulnerability overview with severity breakdown, top risks, complete image inventory with CVE counts, and detailed CVE information per image. See [Vendor Portal Security Center Interfaces](security-center-about#vendor-portal-security-center-interfaces).
- **Enterprise Portal** - Your customers can view CVE reports showing known vulnerabilities, per-image details, and CVE reduction metrics when comparing versions. See [Enterprise Portal Security Center Interface](security-center-about#enterprise-portal-security-center-interface).

## SBOM Generation

### How It Works

Replicated generates Software Bills of Materials using [Syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft), an open-source SBOM generation tool from Anchore. SBOMs are created in the industry-standard SPDX JSON format, which satisfies most compliance and security audit requirements.

### The Generation Process

1. For each container image in your release, SecureBuild runs Syft to catalog all software components
2. Syft analyzes the image layers and extracts package information from various sources (OS packages, language-specific manifests like package.json, go.mod, requirements.txt, etc.)
3. The output is a comprehensive SPDX document listing every software component, version, license, and relationship
4. SBOMs are generated for multiple architectures (amd64 and arm64) when available
5. The generated SBOMs are stored and served through the API for download
6. If a release associated image digest is updated, the associated release version SBOM will be regenerated, which will update calculated CVEs as well

### What You See

- **Vendor Portal** - You can download SBOMs in SPDX format for a given release. Go to the **Security** tab for a specific release version under **Releases** in Vendor Portal. The SBOM includes detailed component information necessary for supply chain security, compliance reporting, and license auditing.
- **Enterprise Portal** - Your customers can also download release specific SBOMs in SPDX format from the Enterprise Portal's Security tab. 

## Requirements

To use Security Center features:

- **Replicated SDK** v1.9.0 or later for customer instance reporting
- **Unique HelmChart custom resources** per chart (for Helm-based applications)
- **Security Center feature flag** enabled by your Replicated account team

For additional requirements and limitations, see [Requirements](security-center-about#requirements) and [Limitations](security-center-about#limitations).
