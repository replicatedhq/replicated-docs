# Helm CLI-Only Onboarding

This topic describes how to onboard applications that will support Helm CLI installations only.

If your application will also support KOTS and Embedded Cluster installations in addition to Helm CLI installations, see [KOTS and Embedded Cluster Onboarding](distributing-workflow). 

## Before You Begin

This section includes guidance and prerequisites to review before you begin onboarding your application.

### Prerequisites

<Prerequisites/>

* <Cluster/>

### Best Practices and Recommendations

<BestPractices/>

### Getting Help from the Community

<Community/>

## Onboarding

### Task 0: Create an Application

<CreateApp/>

### Task 0: Connect Your Image Registry

<ImageRegistry/>

### Task 0: Add the Replicated SDK as a Dependency

<PackageSdk/>

<DependencyYaml/>

### Task 0: Enable the Proxy Service and Add Your Helm Chart to a Release

The Replicated proxy service allows you to grant proxy access to your application images without sharing registry credentials with your users.

To enable the proxy service for Helm CLI installations:

<EnableProxyService/>

### Task 0: Add a Custom Domain for the Proxy Service

<CustomDomains/>

### Task 0: Add Preflight Checks and Support Bundles

<AboutPreflightsSupportBundles/>

#### Task 0a: Define Preflight Checks

<Preflights/>

#### Task 0b: Add the Default Support Bundle Spec

<SupportBundles/>

### Task 8: Add and Query Custom License Entitlements

<CustomEntitlements/>

For more information, see:
* [Managing Custom License Fields](/vendor/licenses-adding-custom-fields)
* [Querying Entitlements with the Replicated SDK API](/vendor/licenses-reference-sdk)
* [Verifying License Field Signatures with the Replicated SDK API](/vendor/licenses-verify-fields-sdk-api)
* [Creating and Managing Customers](/vendor/releases-creating-customer)
* [Developing Against the SDK API](/vendor/replicated-sdk-development)

## Next Steps

After completing the main onboarding tasks, Replicated recommends that you also complete the following additional tasks to integrate other Replicated features with your application. You can complete these next recommended tasks in any order.

### Customize the Default Support Bundle Spec

<CustomizeSupportBundles/>

### Add Custom Metrics

<CustomMetrics/>

### Integrate with CI/CD and Compatibility Matrix

<CiCd/>

### Customize Release Channels

<CustomChannels/>
