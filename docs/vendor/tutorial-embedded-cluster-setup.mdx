# Introduction and Setup

This topic provides a summary of the goals and outcomes for the tutorial and also lists the prerequisites to set up your environment before you begin.

## Summary

This tutorial introduces you to installing an application on a Linux virtual machine (VM) using Replicated Embedded Cluster. Embedded Cluster allows you to distribute a Kubernetes cluster and your application together as a single appliance, making it easy for enterprise users to install, update, and manage the application and the cluster in tandem.

In this tutorial, you use a sample application to learn how to:

* Add the Embedded Cluster Config to a release
* Use Embedded Cluster to install the application on a Linux VM

## Set Up the Environment

Before you begin, ensure that you have access to a VM that meets the requirements for Embedded Cluster:
* Linux operating system
* x86-64 architecture
* Embedded cluster is based on k0s, so all k0s system requirements apply. See [System requirements](https://docs.k0sproject.io/head/system-requirements/) in the k0s documentation.

## Next Step

Install the Replicated CLI and create an application in the Replicated Vendor Portal. See [Step 1: Create an Application](/vendor/tutorial-embedded-cluster-create-app).
