## Overview

<EmbeddedCluster/>

The following diagram demonstrates how Kubernetes and an application are installed into a customer environment using Embedded Cluster: 

![Embedded Cluster installs an app in a customer environment](/images/embedded-cluster-install.png)

As shown in the diagram above, the Embedded Cluster Config is included in the application release in the Replicated Vendor Portal and is used to generate the Embedded Cluster installation assets. Users can download these installation assets from the Replicated app service (`replicated.app`) on the command line, then run the Embedded Cluster installation command to install Kubernetes and the KOTS Admin Console. Finally, users access the Admin Console to optionally add nodes to the cluster and to configure and install the application.

### Limitations

Embedded Cluster has the following limitations:

* **Reach out about migrating from kURL**: We are helping several customers migrate from kURL to Embedded Cluster. Reach out to Alex Parker at alexp@replicated.com for more information.

* **Multi-node support is in beta**: Support for multi-node embedded clusters is in beta, and enabling high availability for multi-node clusters is in alpha. Only single-node embedded clusters are generally available. For more information, see [Managing Multi-Node Clusters with Embedded Cluster](/enterprise/embedded-manage-nodes).

* **Disaster recovery is in alpha**: Disaster Recovery for Embedded Cluster installations is in alpha. For more information, see [Disaster Recovery for Embedded Cluster (Alpha)](/vendor/embedded-disaster-recovery).

* **Partial rollback support**: In Embedded Cluster 1.17.0 and later, rollbacks are supported only when rolling back to a version where there is no change to the [Embedded Cluster Config](/reference/embedded-config) compared to the currently-installed version. For example, users can roll back to release version 1.0.0 after upgrading to 1.1.0 only if both 1.0.0 and 1.1.0 use the same Embedded Cluster Config. For more information about how to enable rollbacks for your application in the KOTS Application custom resource, see [allowRollback](/reference/custom-resource-application#allowrollback) in _Application_.

* **Changing node hostnames is not supported**: After a host is added to a Kubernetes cluster, Kubernetes assumes that the hostname and IP address of the host will not change. If you need to change the hostname or IP address of a node, you must first remove the node from the cluster. For more information about the requirements for naming nodes, see [Node name uniqueness](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/#node-name-uniqueness) in the Kubernetes documentation.

* **Automatic updates not supported**: Configuring automatic updates from the Admin Console so that new versions are automatically deployed is not supported for Embedded Cluster installations. For more information, see [Configuring Automatic Updates](/enterprise/updating-apps).

* **Embedded Cluster installation assets not available through the Download Portal**: The assets required to install with Embedded Cluster cannot be shared with users through the Download Portal. Users can follow the Embedded Cluster installation instructions to download and extract the installation assets. For more information, see [Online Installation with Embedded Cluster](/enterprise/installing-embedded).

* **`minKotsVersion` and `targetKotsVersion` not supported**: The [`minKotsVersion`](/reference/custom-resource-application#minkotsversion-beta) and [`targetKotsVersion`](/reference/custom-resource-application#targetkotsversion) fields in the KOTS Application custom resource are not supported for Embedded Cluster installations. This is because each version of Embedded Cluster includes a particular version of KOTS. Setting `targetKotsVersion` or `minKotsVersion` to a version of KOTS that does not coincide with the version that is included in the specified version of Embedded Cluster will cause Embedded Cluster installations to fail with an error message like: `Error: This version of App Name requires a different version of KOTS from what you currently have installed`. To avoid installation failures, do not use targetKotsVersion or minKotsVersion in releases that support installation with Embedded Cluster.

* **Support bundles over 100MB in the Admin Console**: Support bundles are stored in rqlite. Bundles over 100MB could cause rqlite to crash, causing errors in the installation. You can still generate a support bundle from the command line. For more information, see [Generating Support Bundles for Embedded Cluster](/vendor/support-bundle-embedded).

* **Kubernetes version template functions not supported**: The KOTS [KubernetesVersion](/reference/template-functions-static-context#kubernetesversion), [KubernetesMajorVersion](/reference/template-functions-static-context#kubernetesmajorversion), and [KubernetesMinorVersion](/reference/template-functions-static-context#kubernetesminorversion) template functions do not provide accurate Kubernetes version information for Embedded Cluster installations. This is because these template functions are rendered before the Kubernetes cluster has been updated to the intended version. However, `KubernetesVersion` is not necessary for Embedded Cluster because vendors specify the Embedded Cluster version, which includes a known Kubernetes version.

* **Custom domains not supported**: Embedded Cluster does not support the use of custom domains, even if custom domains are configured. We intend to add support for custom domains. For more information about custom domains, see [About Custom Domains](/vendor/custom-domains). 

* **KOTS Auto-GitOps workflow not supported**: Embedded Cluster does not support the KOTS Auto-GitOps workflow. If an end-user is interested in GitOps, consider the Helm install method instead. For more information, see [Installing with Helm](/vendor/install-with-helm).

* **Downgrading Kubernetes not supported**: Embedded Cluster does not support downgrading Kubernetes. The admin console will not prevent end-users from attempting to downgrade Kubernetes if a more recent version of your application specifies a previous Embedded Cluster version. You must ensure that you do not promote new versions with previous Embedded Cluster versions.

* **Templating not supported in Embedded Cluster Config**: The [Embedded Cluster Config](/reference/embedded-config) resource does not support the use of Go template functions, including [KOTS template functions](/reference/template-functions-about).

* **Policy enforcement on Embedded Cluster workloads is not supported**: The Embedded Cluster runs workloads that require higher levels of privilege. If your application installs a policy enforcement engine such as Gatekeeper or Kyverno, ensure that its policies are not enforced in the namespaces used by Embedded Cluster.

* **Installing on STIG- and CIS-hardened OS images is not supported**: Embedded Cluster isn't tested on these images, and issues have arisen when trying to install on them.

## Quick Start

If you already have a release for your application in the Vendor Portal that supports installation with Replicated KOTS, you can use the following steps to get started quickly with Embedded Cluster:

1. Create a new customer or edit an existing customer and select the **Embedded Cluster Enabled** license option. Save the customer.

1. Create a new release that includes your application as well as the KOTS custom resources. In that release, create an Embedded Cluster Config that includes, at minimum, the Embedded Cluster version you want to use. See the Embedded Cluster [GitHub repo](https://github.com/replicatedhq/embedded-cluster/releases) to find the latest version.

     Example Embedded Cluster Config:

     <EcConfig/>

1. Save the release and promote it to the channel the customer is assigned to.

1. Return to the customer page where you enabled Embedded Cluster. At the top right, click **Install instructions** and choose **Embedded Cluster**. A dialog appears with instructions on how to download the Embedded Cluster installation assets and install your application.

     ![Customer install instructions drop down button](/images/customer-install-instructions-dropdown.png)

     [View a larger version of this image](/images/customer-install-instructions-dropdown.png)
 
1. On your VM, run the commands in the **Embedded Cluster install instructions** dialog.

1. Enter an Admin Console password when prompted.

     The Admin Console URL is printed when the installation finishes. Access the Admin Console to begin installing your application. During the installation process in the Admin Console, you have the opportunity to add nodes if you want a multi-node cluster. Then you can provide application config, run preflights, and deploy your application.

## About Configuring Embedded Cluster

To install an application with Embedded Cluster, an Embedded Cluster Config must be present in the application release. The Embedded Cluster Config lets you define several characteristics about the cluster that will be created.

For more information, see [Embedded Cluster Config](/reference/embedded-config).

## About Installing with Embedded Cluster

This section provides an overview of installing applications with Embedded Cluster.

### Installation Options

Embedded Cluster supports installations in online (internet-connected) environments and air gap environments with no outbound internet access.

For online installations, Embedded Cluster also supports installing behind a proxy server.

For more information about how to install with Embedded Cluster, see:
* [Online Installation wtih Embedded Cluster](/enterprise/installing-embedded)
* [Air Gap Installation with Embedded Cluster](/enterprise/installing-embedded-air-gap)

### Customer-Specific Installation Instructions

To install with Embedded Cluster, you can follow the customer-specific instructions provided on the **Customer** page in the Vendor Portal. For example:

## About Managing Multi-Node Clusters with Embedded Cluster

This section describes managing nodes in multi-node clusters created with Embedded Cluster.

### Defining Node Roles for Multi-Node Clusters

You can optionally define node roles in the Embedded Cluster Config. For multi-node clusters, roles can be useful for the purpose of assigning specific application workloads to nodes. If nodes roles are defined, users access the Admin Console to assign one or more roles to a node when it is joined to the cluster. 

For more information, see [roles](/reference/embedded-config#roles) in _Embedded Cluster Config_.

### Adding Nodes

Users can add nodes to a cluster with Embedded Cluster from the Admin Console. The Admin Console provides the join command used to add nodes to the cluster.

For more information, see [Managing Multi-Node Clusters with Embedded Cluster](/enterprise/embedded-manage-nodes).

### High Availability for Multi-Node Clusters (Alpha)

Multi-node clusters are not highly available by default. Enabling high availability (HA) requires that at least three controller nodes are present in the cluster. Users can enable HA when joining the third node.

For more information about creating HA multi-node clusters with Embedded Cluster, see [Enable High Availability for Multi-Node Clusters (Alpha)](/enterprise/embedded-manage-nodes#ha) in _Managing Multi-Node Clusters with Embedded Cluster_.

## Additional Use Cases

This section outlines some additional use cases for Embedded Cluster. These are not officially supported features from Replicated, but are ways of using Embedded Cluster that we or our customers have experimented with that might be useful to you.

### NVIDIA GPU Operator

The NVIDIA GPU Operator uses the operator framework within Kubernetes to automate the management of all NVIDIA software components needed to provision GPUs. For more information about this operator, see the [NVIDIA GPU Operator](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/gpu-operator/latest/overview.html) documentation. You can include the operator in your release as an additional Helm chart, or using the Embedded Cluster Helm extensions. For information about Helm extensions, see [extensions](/reference/embedded-config#extensions) in _Embedded Cluster Config_.

Using this operator with Embedded Cluster requires configuring the containerd options in the operator as follows:

```yaml
toolkit:
   env:
   - name: CONTAINERD_CONFIG
     value: /etc/k0s/containerd.d/nvidia.toml
   - name: CONTAINERD_SOCKET
     value: /run/k0s/containerd.sock
```
