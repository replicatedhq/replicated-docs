# Using Embedded Cluster (Beta)

This topic describes how to use the Replicated embedded cluster, including how to configure, install, and manage embedded clusters.

## Overview

The embedded cluster is the next generation of Replicated’s embedded cluster offering. As a successor to kURL, the embedded cluster offers significantly faster installation, updates, and node joins; a redesigned admin console UI; improved support for multi-node clusters; one-click updates that update the application and the cluster at once; and more.

### Requirements

Embedded cluster is based on k0s, so all k0s system requirements apply.

Embedded cluster also has the following requirements:

* Linux operating system
* x86-64 architecture

In addition, someone at Replicated must turn on the “Enable Embedded Cluster” feature flag for your team. Once this feature flag is enabled, you can select the “Embedded Cluster Binary Enabled (Alpha)” license option for customers in the vendor portal. Only licenses with this option enabled can download the embedded cluster binary, which is used to install the embedded cluster.

To use the embedded cluster, an embedded cluster config must be created in a release. The embedded cluster config lets you define several things about the cluster that will be created.
