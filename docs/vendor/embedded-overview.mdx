# Using Embedded Cluster (Beta)

This topic describes how to use the Replicated Embedded Cluster to configure, install, and manage your application in an embedded Kubernetes cluster.

:::note
Embedded cluster is in beta. If you are instead looking for information about creating Kubernetes Installers with Replicated kURL, see the [Replicated kURL](/vendor/packaging-embedded-kubernetes) section.

## Overview

<EmbeddedCluster/>

<KurlComparison/>

### Requirements

Embedded cluster has the following requirements:

<Requirements/>

### Limitations

Embedded Cluster has the following limitations:

* **No migration from kURL**: There is not a supported path to migrate an existing kURL instance to Embedded Cluster.

* **Multi-node support is in alpha**: Support for multi-node embedded clusters is in alpha. Only single-node embedded clusters are in beta. To get access to this feature, reach out to Alex Parker at [alexp@replicated.com](mailto:alexp@replicated.com).

* **Air gap support is in alpha**: Support for air gap installations with Embedded Cluster is an alpha feature. To get access to this feature, reach out to Alex Parker at [alexp@replicated.com](mailto:alexp@replicated.com).

* **Disaster recovery is in alpha**: Disaster Recovery for Embedded Cluster installations is in alpha. To get access to this feature, reach out to Alex Parker at [alexp@replicated.com](mailto:alexp@replicated.com).

   :::note
   Embedded Cluster does not support backup and restore with the KOTS snapshots feature. For more information about snapshots, see [Understanding Backup and Restore](/vendor/snapshots-overview).
   :::

* **Rollbacks not supported**: The [`allowRollback`](/reference/custom-resource-application#allowrollback) field in the KOTS Application custom resource is not supported for Embedded Cluster installations. In Embedded Cluster installations, the application and the cluster are installed and updated together as a single appliance. Because of this, users cannot roll back (downgrade) the application to an earlier version.

* **Cannot change `spec.api` and `spec.storage` after installation**: The `spec.api` and `spec.storage` keys in the k0s config cannot be changed after installation. Whereas most keys in the k0s config apply to the whole cluster, these two keys are set for each node. Embedded Cluster cannot update these keys on each individual node during updates, so they cannot be changed after installation.

* **Changing node hostnames is not supported**: After a host is added to a Kubernetes cluster, Kubernetes assumes that the hostname and IP address of the host will not change. If you need to change the hostname or IP address of a node, you must first remove the node from the cluster. For more information about the requirements for naming nodes, see [Node name uniqueness](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/#node-name-uniqueness) in the Kubernetes documentation.

* **Automated installations not supported**: Users cannot do automated (headless) Embedded Cluster installations because it is not possible to configure the application by passing the [ConfigValues](/vendor/releases-configvalues) file with the installation command. Embedded Cluster installations require that the application is configured from the Admin Console config screen. For more information about automating existing cluster or kURL installations with the KOTS CLI, see [Installing with the CLI](/enterprise/installing-existing-cluster-automation).

* **Embedded Cluster release artifact not available through the Download Portal**: The binary required to install with Embedded Cluster cannot be shared with users through the Download Portal. Users can follow the Embedded Cluster installation instructions to download and extract the binary in order to install with Embedded Cluster. For more information, see [Download the Embedded Cluster Binary](/vendor/embedded-overview#download-the-embedded-cluster-binary).

* **`minKotsVersion` and `targetKotsVersion` not supported**: The [`minKotsVersion`](/reference/custom-resource-application#minkotsversion-beta) and [`targetKotsVersion`](/reference/custom-resource-application#targetkotsversion) fields in the KOTS Application custom resource are not supported for Embedded Cluster installations. This is because each version of Embedded Cluster includes a particular version of KOTS. Setting `targetKotsVersion` or `minKotsVersion` to a version of KOTS that does not coincide with the version that is included in the specified version of Embedded Cluster will cause Embedded Cluster installations to fail with an error message like: `Error: This version of App Name requires a different version of KOTS from what you currently have installed`. To avoid installation failures, do not use targetKotsVersion or minKotsVersion in releases that support installation with Embedded Cluster.

* **Support bundles over 100MB**: Support bundles are stored in rqlite. Bundles over 100MB could cause rqlite to crash, causing errors in the installation.

* **Kubernetes version template functions not supported**: The KOTS [KubernetesVersion](/reference/template-functions-static-context#kubernetesversion), [KubernetesMajorVersion](/reference/template-functions-static-context#kubernetesmajorversion), and [KubernetesMinorVersion](/reference/template-functions-static-context#kubernetesminorversion) template functions do not provide accurate Kubernetes version information for Embedded Cluster installations. This is because these template functions are rendered before the Kubernetes cluster has been updated to the intended version. However, `KubernetesVersion` is not necessary for Embedded Cluster because vendors specify the Embedded Cluster version, which includes a known Kubernetes version.

* **Custom domains not supported**: Embedded Cluster does not support the use of custom domains, even if custom domains are configured. We intend to add support for custom domains. For more information about custom domains, see [About Custom Domains](/vendor/custom-domains). 

* **KOTS Auto-GitOps workflow not supported**: Embedded Cluster does not support the KOTS Auto-GitOps workflow. If an end-user is interested in GitOps, consider the Helm install method instead. For more information, see [Installing with Helm](/vendor/install-with-helm).

* **Upgrading by more than one Kubernetes minor version not supported**: Embedded Cluster does not support upgrading Kubernetes by more than one minor version at a time. The Kubernetes minor version is present in the build metadata for an Embedded Cluster version (e.g., X.Y.Z+k8s-1.28). For example, if an end-user is running X.Y.Z+k8s-1.28, they must upgrade to X.Y.Z+k8s-1.29 before they can upgrade to X.Y.Z+k8s-1.30. The Embedded Cluster version X.Y.Z can be the same or different during these upgrades. The Admin Console will not prevent end-users from attempting to upgrade by more than one Kubernetes minor version at a time, so you must manage this with your customers.

* **Downgrading Kubernetes not supported**: Embedded Cluster does not support downgrading Kubernetes. The admin console will not prevent end-users from attempting to downgrade Kubernetes if a more recent version of your application specifies a previous Embedded Cluster version. You must ensure that you do not promote new versions with previous Embedded Cluster versions.

### Known Issue

When a customer instance fetches a new version of your application, the version is rendered by the currently deployed version of KOTS. If your new application version uses functionality that the currently deployed version of KOTS doesn't support, your application version will not be rendered and cannot be upgraded to. In the interim, we are limiting new functionality introduced in KOTS that could trigger this issue, and we are working on a solution.

## Quick Start

You can use the following steps to get started quickly with Embedded Cluster. More detailed documentation is available below.

1. Create a new customer or edit an existing customer and select the **Embedded Cluster Enabled (Beta)** license option. Save the customer.

1. Create a new release that includes your application. In that release, create an embedded cluster config that includes, at minimum, the Embedded Cluster version you want to use. See the Embedded Cluster [GitHub repo](https://github.com/replicatedhq/embedded-cluster/releases) to find the latest version.

     Example Embedded Cluster config:

     ```yaml
     apiVersion: embeddedcluster.replicated.com/v1beta1
     kind: Config
     spec:
       version: 1.6.0+k8s-1.29
     ```

1. Save the release and promote it to the channel your customer is assigned to.

1. Return to the customer page where you enabled Embedded Cluster. At the top right, click **Install instructions** and choose **Embedded cluster**. A dialog appears with instructions on how to download the Embedded Cluster binary and install your application.

     ![Customer install instructions drop down button](/images/customer-install-instructions-dropdown.png)

     [View a larger version of this image](/images/customer-install-instructions-dropdown.png)
 
1. On your VM, run the commands in the **Embedded Cluster install instructions** dialog.

     <img alt="Embedded cluster install instruction dialog" src="/images/embedded-cluster-install-dialog.png" width="550px"/>

     [View a larger version of this image](/images/embedded-cluster-install-dialog.png)

1. Enter an Admin Console password when prompted.

     The Admin Console URL is printed when the installation finishes. Access the Admin Console to begin installing your application. You’ll have the opportunity to add nodes if you want a multi-node cluster. Then you can provide application config, run preflights, and deploy your application.

## Configure Embedded Cluster

To install your application with Embedded Cluster, an Embedded Cluster config must be created in a release. The Embedded Cluster config lets you define several characteristics about the cluster that will be created.

For more information, see [Embedded Cluster Config](/reference/embedded-config).

## Download the Embedded Cluster Binary

To install your application with Embedded Cluster, you need to download an Embedded Cluster binary and a license. The binary is specific to your application release: it installs that particular version of your application using the Embedded Cluster config defined in that release.

Your customers can download the binary using the Replicated app service, or you can host/serve the binary yourself using the Replicated Vendor API.

### Using the Replicated App Service

For online installations, your customers can run a command to download the Embedded Cluster binary and their license directly to the machine where they will install your application. The command to download the binary and license is easily available on the customer page in the vendor portal. You can copy this and share it with your customers.

To download the binary using the Replicated app service:

1. Create a new customer or edit an existing customer and select the **Embedded Cluster Enabled (Beta)** license option. Save the customer.

1. At the top right of the customer page, click **Install instructions** and choose **Embedded cluster**. An **Embedded cluster installation instructions** dialog appears with instructions on how to download the Embedded Cluster binary and install your application.

     ![Customer install instructions drop down button](/images/customer-install-instructions-dropdown.png)

     [View a larger version of this image](/images/customer-install-instructions-dropdown.png)

1. On a VM, run the first two commands displayed on the **Embedded cluster installation instructions** dialog to download the binary and license and extract them.

     The following shows an example of the **Embedded cluster installation instructions** dialog:

     <img alt="Embedded cluster install instruction dialog" src="/images/embedded-cluster-install-dialog.png" width="550px"/>

     [View a larger version of this image](/images/embedded-cluster-install-dialog.png)

If you need to download the binary for a particular version of your application, you can add `/VERSION_LABEL` to the end of the `curl` command in the screenshot above.

Example:

```
curl https://replicated.app/embedded/gitea-mastodon/unstable/1.2.3
```

:::note
You can configure a custom domain for the `replicated.app` endpoint so that your customers can download the binary from your own domain instead of from `replicated.app`. For more information, see [About Custom Domains](/vendor/custom-domains).
:::

### Using the Vendor API

Some vendors already have a portal that their customers log in to to access documentation or download artifacts. In cases like this, you can serve the Embedded Cluster binary yourself using the Replicated Vendor API.

To serve the binary with the Vendor API:

1. If you have not done so already, create an API token for the Vendor API. See [Using the Vendor API v3](/reference/vendor-api-using#api-token-requirement).

1. Call the [Get an Embedded Cluster release](https://replicated-vendor-api.readme.io/reference/getembeddedclusterrelease) endpoint to download the artifacts needed to install your application in an embedded cluster. Your customers must take this binary and their license and copy them to the machine where they will install your application.

     Note the following:

     * (Recommended) Provide the `customerId` query parameter so that the customer’s license is included in the downloaded tarball. This mirrors what is returned when a customer downloads the binary directly using the Replicated app service and is the most useful option. Excluding the `customerId` is useful if you plan to distribute the license separately.

     * If you do not provide any query parameters, this endpoint downloads the Embedded Cluster binary for the latest release on the specified channel. You can provide the `channelSequence` query parameter to download the binary for a particular release.


## Install

Your customers can install your application once they have obtained the Embedded Cluster binary and their license and copied them to the machine where they will install your application. For more information about how to get the binary and license, see [Download the Embedded Cluster Binary](#download-the-embedded-cluster-binary) above.

To install your application in an embedded cluster:

1. SSH onto the machine where you will install your application.

1. Ensure that the Embedded Cluster binary and the license are available in the working directory.

1. Install the application:

    ```
    sudo ./APP_SLUG install --license LICENSE_FILE
    ```
    Where:
    * `APP_SLUG` is the unique slug for the application.
    * `LICENSE_FILE` is the customer's license.

1. Enter an Admin Console password when prompted.

     The Admin Console URL is printed when the installation finishes. Access the Admin Console to begin installing your application. You’ll have the opportunity to add nodes if you want a multi-node cluster. Then you can provide application config, run preflights, and deploy your application.

### Install Behind a Proxy Server

The following flags can be used with the Embedded Cluster `install` command to install behind a proxy server:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th width="35%">Flag</th>
    <th width="65%">Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
     <td>`--http-proxy`</td>
     <td>Proxy server to use for HTTP</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
     <td>`--https-proxy`</td>
     <td>Proxy server to use for HTTPS</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
     <td>`--no-proxy`</td>
     <td>Comma-separated list of hosts for which not to use a proxy</td>
  </tr>
</table>

**Example:**

```bash
sudo ./APP_SLUG install --license LICENSE_FILE \
  --http-proxy=HOST:PORT \
  --https-proxy=HOST:PORT \
  --no-proxy=LIST_OF_HOSTS
```

Where:

* `LICENSE_FILE` is the customer's license
* `HOST:PORT` is the host and port of the proxy server
* `LIST_OF_HOSTS` is the list of hosts to not proxy

For multi-node clusters, the proxy settings are automatically configured when joining additional nodes. When deploying the first node of a multi-node cluster, you should pass the node IP addresses (typically in CIDR notation) to `--no-proxy`.

The following are never proxied:
* Internal cluster communication (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `.default`, `.local`, `.svc`, `kubernetes`)
* Communiation to the KOTS database (`kotsadm-rqlite`)
* The CIDR used for assigning IPs to Kubernetes Pods and Services (`10.0.0.0/8`)

**Requirement:**

Proxy installations require Embedded Cluster 1.5.1 or later with Kubernetes 1.29 or later. For example, Embedded Cluster 1.6.0+k8s-1.29 supports installing behind a proxy, and 1.6.0+k8s-1.28 does not. For the latest version information, see the [embedded-cluster](https://github.com/replicatedhq/embedded-cluster/releases) repository in GitHub.

**Limitations:**
* Proxy settings are not automatically propagated to your [Helm extensions](/reference/embedded-config#helm-extensions) and must be manually configured.
* Proxy settings cannot be changed after installation or during upgrade.

### Set IP Address Ranges for Pods and Services

The following flags can be used with the Embedded Cluster `install` command to allocate IP address ranges for Pods and Services:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th width="35%">Flag</th>
    <th width="65%">Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
     <td>`--pod-cidr`</td>
     <td>The range of IP addresses that can be assigned to Pods, in CIDR notation. By default, the Pod CIDR is 10.96.0.0/12.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
     <td>`--service-cidr`</td>
     <td>The range of IP addresses that can be assigned to Services, in CIDR notation. By default, the Service CIDR is 10.244.0.0/16.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


**Example:**

```bash
sudo ./my-app install --license license.yaml --pod-cidr 172.16.136.0/16
```

**Limitation:**

The `--pod-cidr` and `--service-cidr` flags are not supported on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9 operating systems.

### Host Preflight Checks

During installation, Embedded Cluster automatically runs a default set of _host preflight checks_. The default host preflight checks are designed to verify that the installation environment meets the requirements for Embedded Cluster, such as:
* The system has sufficient disk space
* The system has at least 2G of memory and 2 CPU cores
* The system clock is synchronized

For the full default host preflight spec for Embedded Cluster, see [`host-preflight.yaml`](https://github.com/replicatedhq/embedded-cluster/blob/main/pkg/preflights/host-preflight.yaml) in the `embedded-cluster` repository in GitHub.

If any of the host preflight checks fail, installation is blocked and a message describing the failure is displayed. For more information about host preflight checks for installations on VMs or bare metal servers, see [(KOTS Only) Host Preflights for VM or Bare Metal Installations](preflight-support-bundle-about#host-preflights).

#### Limitations

Embedded Cluster host preflight checks have the following limitations:

* The default host preflight checks for Embedded Cluster cannot be modified, and vendors cannot provide their own custom host preflight spec for Embedded Cluster.
* Host preflight checks do not check that any application-specific requirements are met. For more information about defining preflight checks for your application, see [Defining Preflight Checks](/vendor/preflight-defining).

#### Skip Host Preflight Checks

You can skip host preflight checks by passing the `--skip-host-preflights` flag with the Embedded Cluster `install` command. For example:

```bash
sudo ./my-app install --license license.yaml --skip-host-preflights
```

When you skip host preflight checks, the Admin Console still runs any application-specific preflight checks that are defined in the release before the application is deployed.

:::note
Skipping host preflight checks is _not_ recommended for production installations.
:::

### Host Storage

Embedded Cluster stores data in the following primary locations, all of which must be writable:

:::note
Replicated does not support using symlinked directories for these locations.
:::

#### `/var/lib/embedded-cluster`

- Used to store your installer
- Includes:
  * Logs
  * Temporary files
  * Supporting binaries (e.g., kubectl and Replicated’s preflight and support-bundle plugins)
- Should be large enough to fit at least 2 installer binaries

#### `/var/lib/k0s`

- Where the Kubernetes cluster runs
- Includes:
  * All Kubernetes components and binaries
  * Pod log files
  * Images currently in use by containerd
- Storage requirements:
  * The total space should be sufficient to hold the following while remaining below 85% utilization:
    * All Pod logs
    * Two copies of infrastructure images included in k0s
    * All Pod images for your application
  * Kubernetes will initiate garbage collection of images when utilization reaches 85%
- Calculation example:
  If the sum of required storage for logs, images, and components is X GB, the total allocated space should be at least X / 0.85 GB to ensure it remains below 85% utilization.

#### `/var/openebs`

- Where PVC data is stored
- Needs enough storage to support all volumes used in your application
- For airgap installs:
  * Registry uses a volume
  * Requires space for two copies of your images (for registry)
  * Additional space needed for other application volume requirements
  * If high availability is enabled, all controller nodes will have the same requirements because data will be replicated to all controller nodes.

#### `/tmp`
- Temporary space during installation

## Update

When you update an application installed in an Embedded Cluster, you update both the application and the cluster together. There is no need or mechanism to update the Embedded Cluster on its own.

You can check for available application updates in the Admin Console, or use automatic updates, to retrieve newly available versions. When you deploy a new version, any changes to your application are deployed first. The Admin Console waits until your application is ready, as indicated by status informers, before making any changes to the cluster.

Any changes made to the Embedded Cluster config, including changes to the Embedded Cluster version, Helm extensions, and unsupported overrides, trigger a cluster update.

During cluster updates, the Admin Console can experience downtime and become unavailable if the Kubernetes version is updated. If you’re already viewing the Admin Console when the downtime occurs, you will see a message informing you that a cluster update is in progress and that the connection will resume once the Admin Console is available again:

<img alt="Embedded cluster update in progress modal" src="/images/embedded-cluster-update-in-progress.png" width="400px"/>

[View a larger version of this image](/images/embedded-cluster-update-in-progress.png)

:::important
Do not downgrade the Embedded Cluster version. This is not supported but is not prohibited, and it can lead to unexpected behavior.
:::

## Access the Cluster

With Embedded Cluster, end-users are rarely supposed to need to use the CLI. Typical workflows, like updating the application and the cluster, are driven through the Admin Console.

Nonetheless, there are times when vendors or their customers need to use the CLI for development or troubleshooting.

To access the cluster and use other included binaries:

1. SSH onto a controller node.

1. Use the Embedded Cluster shell command to start a shell with access to the cluster:

     ```
     sudo ./APP_SLUG shell
     ```

     The output looks similar to the following:
     ```
        __4___
    _  \ \ \ \   Welcome to APP_SLUG debug shell.
    <'\ /_/_/_/   This terminal is now configured to access your cluster.
    ((____!___/) Type 'exit' (or CTRL+d) to exit.
    \0\0\0\0\/  Happy hacking.
    ~~~~~~~~~~~
    root@alex-ec-2:/home/alex# export KUBECONFIG="/var/lib/k0s/pki/admin.conf"
    root@alex-ec-2:/home/alex# export PATH="$PATH:/var/lib/embedded-cluster/bin"
    root@alex-ec-2:/home/alex# source <(kubectl completion bash)
    root@alex-ec-2:/home/alex# source /etc/bash_completion
    ```

     The appropriate kubeconfig is exported, and the location of useful binaries like kubectl and Replicated’s preflight and support-bundle plugins is added to PATH.

     :::note
     The shell command cannot be run on non-controller nodes.
     :::

1. Use the available binaries as needed.

     **Example**:

     ```bash
     kubectl version
     ```
     ```
     Client Version: v1.29.1
     Kustomize Version: v5.0.4-0.20230601165947-6ce0bf390ce3
     Server Version: v1.29.1+k0s
     ```

1. Type `exit` or **Ctrl + D** to exit the shell.

     :::note
     If you encounter a typical workflow where your customers have to use the Embedded Cluster shell, reach out to Alex Parker at alexp@replicated.com. These workflows might be candidates for additional Admin Console functionality.
     :::

### Troubleshoot

From the shell, you can generate a support bundle for the Embedded Cluster to help with troubleshooting.

The support bundle collects host-level information to troubleshoot failures related to host configuration like DNS, networking, or storage problems. It also collects cluster-level information about the components provided by Replicated, such as the Admin Console and Embedded Cluster operator that manage install and upgrade operations.

If the cluster hasn't installed successfully and cluster-level information is not available, it will be excluded from the bundle.

To generate a support bundle:

1. Access the Embedded Cluster shell:
     ```
     sudo ./APP_SLUG shell
     ```

2. Generate the support bundle:
     ```
     kubectl support-bundle /var/lib/embedded-cluster/support/host-support-bundle.yaml --load-cluster-specs
     ```

You can then use the support bundle for troubleshooting or provide it to Replicated for assistance.

## Manage Nodes

The section describes managing nodes in clusters created with Embedded Cluster, including how to add or reset nodes.

### Add Nodes (Alpha)

You can add nodes and create a multi-node cluster. When adding nodes, you select one or more roles for that node, depending on which roles are defined in the Embedded Cluster config. The Admin Console provides the join command you use to join nodes to the cluster.

For more information about defining node roles, see [Roles](/reference/embedded-config#roles) in _Embedded Cluster Config_.

To add nodes to a cluster:

1. In the Admin Console, click **Cluster Management** at the top.

     When initially installing the application, you are brought to this page automatically after logging into the Admin Console.

1. Click **Add node**.

1. In the **Add a Node** dialog, select one or more roles for this node. If no custom roles are defined, the role selection will not appear and only the join command will show.

     <img alt="Add node page in the Admin Console" src="/images/admin-console-add-node.png" width="600px"/>

     [View a larger version of this image](/images/admin-console-add-node.png)

1. Copy the provided join command.

     **Example:**

     ```
     sudo ./APP_SLUG join 10.128.0.43:30000 bM8DO3MNvkouz9TFK3TcFanI
     ```


1. SSH onto the machine you want to join to the cluster. Ensure that the Embedded Cluster binary is available on that node. For more information on downloading the Embedded Cluster binary, see Installing.

     :::important
     You must join nodes with the same installer that you used for the first node. If you use a different installer from a different release of your application, the cluster will not be stable.
     :::

1. Run the copied join command using the Embedded Cluster binary.

1. Check the **Cluster Management** page in the Admin Console to see the node appear and wait for the status to change to Ready.

1. Repeat the process for as many nodes as you would like to add.


### Reset a Node

Resetting a node removes the cluster and your application from that node. This is useful for iteration, development, and when mistakes are made, so you can reset a machine and reuse it instead of having to procure another machine.

If you want to completely remove a cluster, you need to reset each node individually.

When resetting a node, OpenEBS PVCs on the node are deleted. Only PVCs created as part of a StatefulSet will be recreated automatically on another node. To recreate other PVCs, the application will need to be redeployed.

To reset the node of a cluster:

1. SSH onto the machine. Ensure that the Embedded Cluster binary is still available on that machine. For more information on downloading the Embedded Cluster binary, see [Download the Embedded Cluster Binary](#download-the-embedded-cluster-binary) above.

1. Run the reset command to reset the node. The `--reboot` flag automatically reboots the machine to ensure that transient configuration is also reset.

     ```
     sudo ./APP_SLUG reset --reboot
     ```

     :::note
     Pass the `--no-prompt` flag to disable interactive prompts. Pass the `--force` flag to ignore any errors encountered during the reset.
     :::

## Additional Use Cases

This section outlines some additional use cases for Embedded Cluster. These are not officially supported features from Replicated, but are ways of using Embedded Cluster that we or our customers have experimented with that might be useful to you.

### NVIDIA GPU Operator

The NVIDIA GPU Operator uses the operator framework within Kubernetes to automate the management of all NVIDIA software components needed to provision GPUs. For more information about this operator, see the [NVIDIA GPU Operator](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/gpu-operator/latest/overview.html) documentation. You can include the operator in your release as an additional Helm chart, or using the Embedded Cluster Helm extensions. For information about Helm extensions, see [Helm extensions](/reference/embedded-config#helm-extensions) in _Embedded Cluster Config_.

Using this operator with Embedded Cluster requires configuring the containerd options in the operator as follows:

```yaml
toolkit:
   env:
   - name: CONTAINERD_CONFIG
     value: /etc/k0s/containerd.d/nvidia.toml
   - name: CONTAINERD_SOCKET
     value: /run/k0s/containerd.sock
```
