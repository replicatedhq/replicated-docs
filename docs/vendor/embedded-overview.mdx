# Using Embedded Cluster (Beta)

This topic describes how to use the Replicated Embedded Cluster to configure, install, and manage your application in an embedded Kubernetes cluster.

:::note
Embedded cluster is in beta. If you are instead looking for information about creating Kubernetes Installers with Replicated kURL, see the [Replicated kURL](/vendor/packaging-embedded-kubernetes) section.
:::

## Overview

<EmbeddedCluster/>

<KurlComparison/>

### Requirements

Embedded cluster has the following requirements:

* Linux operating system
* x86-64 architecture
* systemd
* Embedded cluster is based on k0s, so all k0s system requirements apply. See [System requirements](https://docs.k0sproject.io/head/system-requirements/) in the k0s documentation.

### Limitations and Known Issues

This section lists the limitations and known issues for Embedded Cluster.

#### Limitations

Embedded cluster has the following limitations:

* **Multi-node support is in alpha**: You can create multi-node embedded clusters, but this feature is in alpha. Only single-node embedded clusters are in beta.

* **No migration from kURL**: There is not yet a way to migrate a kURL instance to Embedded Cluster. We intend to build a migration or upgrade for kURL instances. There are many ways that this could be built, each with various tradeoffs.

* **Cannot change `spec.api` and `spec.storage` after installation**: The `spec.api` and `spec.storage` keys in the k0s config cannot be changed after installation. Whereas most keys in the k0s config apply to the whole cluster, these two keys are set for each node. Embedded cluster cannot update these keys on each individual node during updates, so they cannot be changed after installation.

* **GitOps workflow not supported**: Embedded Cluster does not support using the GitOps workflow. We do not intend to support the GitOps workflow for Embedded Cluster in the future. If an end-user is interested in GitOps, consider the Helm install method instead.

* **Cannot install behind a proxy**: Embedded Cluster cannot yet be configured to use a proxy.

#### Known Issues

The following known issues exist:

* When a customer instance fetches a new version of your application, the version is rendered by the currently deployed version of KOTS. If your new application version uses functionality that the currently deployed version of KOTS doesn't support, your application version will not be rendered and cannot be upgraded to. In the interim, we are limiting new functionality introduced in KOTS that could trigger this issue, and we are working on a solution.

### kURL Feature Parity

The following features that are available in kURL are not yet available in Embedded Cluster. Unless otherwise noted, some of these features might not be available at GA:

* **Backup and restore with Velero**: Velero is not yet installed as part of Embedded Cluster, so backup and restore is unavailable.

* **Distributed storage with Rook**: OpenEBS is the only storage provider available today. We plan to introduce Rook as an alternative for multi-node clusters after GA.

* **Monitoring with Prometheus**: The Prometheus stack is not deployed as part of Embedded Cluster. No default graphs show on the Admin Console dashboard, and you cannot create custom graphs.

* **Access the Admin Console with an identity provider**: Identity provider is a beta feature that is exclusive to kURL. It is not available for Embedded Cluster installations.

:::note
If you require any of these features to use Embedded Cluster, reach out to Alex Parker at alexp@replicated.com.

## Quick Start

You can use the following steps to get started quickly with Embedded Cluster. More detailed documentation is available below.

1. Create a new customer or edit an existing customer and select the **Embedded Cluster Enabled (Beta)** license option. Save the customer.

1. Create a new release that includes your application. In that release, create an embedded cluster config that includes, at minimum, the Embedded Cluster version you want to use. See the Embedded Cluster [GitHub repo](https://github.com/replicatedhq/embedded-cluster/releases) to find the latest version.

     Example Embedded Cluster config:

     ```yaml
     apiVersion: embeddedcluster.replicated.com/v1beta1
     kind: Config
     spec:
       version: 1.3.0+k8s-1.29
     ```

1. Save the release and promote it to the channel your customer is assigned to.

1. Return to the customer page where you enabled Embedded Cluster. At the top right, click **Install instructions** and choose **Embedded cluster**. A dialog appears with instructions on how to download the Embedded Cluster binary and install your application.

     ![Customer install instructions drop down button](/images/customer-install-instructions-dropdown.png)

     [View a larger version of this image](/images/customer-install-instructions-dropdown.png)
 
1. On your VM, run the commands in the **Embedded Cluster install instructions** dialog.

     <img alt="Embedded cluster install instruction dialog" src="/images/embedded-cluster-install-dialog.png" width="550px"/>

     [View a larger version of this image](/images/embedded-cluster-install-dialog.png)

1. Enter an Admin Console password when prompted.

     The Admin Console URL is printed when the installation finishes. Access the Admin Console to begin installing your application. You’ll have the opportunity to add nodes if you want a multi-node cluster. Then you can provide application config, run preflights, and deploy your application.



## Configure Embedded Cluster

To install your application with Embedded Cluster, an Embedded Cluster config must be created in a release. The Embedded Cluster config lets you define several characteristics about the cluster that will be created.

For more information, see [Embedded Cluster Config](/reference/embedded-config).

## Download the Embedded Cluster Binary

To install your application with Embedded Cluster, you need to download an Embedded Cluster binary and a license. The binary is specific to your application release: it installs that particular version of your application using the Embedded Cluster config defined in that release.

Your customers can download the binary using the Replicated app service, or you can host/serve the binary yourself using the Replicated Vendor API.

### Using the Replicated App Service

For online installations, your customers can run a command to download the Embedded Cluster binary and their license directly to the machine where they will install your application. The command to download the binary and license is easily available on the customer page in the vendor portal. You can copy this and share it with your customers.

To download the binary using the Replicated app service:

1. Create a new customer or edit an existing customer and select the **Embedded Cluster Enabled (Beta)** license option. Save the customer.

1. At the top right of the customer page, click **Install instructions** and choose **Embedded cluster**. An **Embedded cluster installation instructions** dialog appears with instructions on how to download the Embedded Cluster binary and install your application.

     ![Customer install instructions drop down button](/images/customer-install-instructions-dropdown.png)

     [View a larger version of this image](/images/customer-install-instructions-dropdown.png)

1. On a VM, run the first two commands displayed on the **Embedded cluster installation instructions** dialog to download the binary and license and extract them.

     The following shows an example of the **Embedded cluster installation instructions** dialog:

     <img alt="Embedded cluster install instruction dialog" src="/images/embedded-cluster-install-dialog.png" width="550px"/>

     [View a larger version of this image](/images/embedded-cluster-install-dialog.png)

     :::note
     You can configure a custom domain for the `replicated.app` endpoint so that your customers can download the binary from your own domain instead of from `replicated.app`. For more information, see [About Custom Domains](/vendor/custom-domains).
     :::

### Using the Vendor API

Some vendors already have a portal that their customers log in to to access documentation or download artifacts. In cases like this, you can serve the Embedded Cluster binary yourself using the Replicated Vendor API.

To serve the binary with the Vendor API:

1. If you have not done so already, create an API token for the Vendor API. See [Using the Vendor API v3](/reference/vendor-api-using#api-token-requirement).

1. Call the [Get an Embedded Cluster release](https://replicated-vendor-api.readme.io/reference/getembeddedclusterrelease) endpoint to download the artifacts needed to install your application in an embedded cluster. Your customers must take this binary and their license and copy them to the machine where they will install your application.

     Note the following:

     * (Recommended) Provide the `customerId` query parameter so that the customer’s license is included in the downloaded tarball. This mirrors what is returned when a customer downloads the binary directly using the Replicated app service and is the most useful option. Excluding the `customerId` is useful if you plan to distribute the license separately.

     * If you do not provide any query parameters, this endpoint downloads the Embedded Cluster binary for the latest release on the specified channel. You can provide the `channelSequence` query parameter to download the binary for a particular release.


## Install

Your customers can install your application once they have obtained the Embedded Cluster binary and their license and copied them to the machine where they will install your application. For more information about how to get the binary and license, see [Download the Embedded Cluster Binary](#download-the-embedded-cluster-binary) above.

To install your application in an embedded cluster:

1. SSH onto the machine where you will install your application.

1. Ensure that the Embedded Cluster binary and the license are available in the working directory.

1. Install the application:

    ```
    sudo ./APP_SLUG install --license LICENSE_FILE
    ```
    Where:
    * `APP_SLUG` is the unique slug for the application.
    * `LICENSE_FILE` is the customer's license.

1. Enter an Admin Console password when prompted.

     The Admin Console URL is printed when the installation finishes. Access the Admin Console to begin installing your application. You’ll have the opportunity to add nodes if you want a multi-node cluster. Then you can provide application config, run preflights, and deploy your application.


## Update

When you update an application installed in an Embedded Cluster, you update both the application and the cluster together. There is no need or mechanism to update the Embedded Cluster on its own.

You can check for available application updates in the Admin Console, or use automatic updates, to retrieve newly available versions. When you deploy a new version, any changes to your application are deployed first. The Admin Console waits until your application is ready, as indicated by status informers, before making any changes to the cluster.

Any changes made to the Embedded Cluster config, including changes to the Embedded Cluster version, Helm extensions, and unsupported overrides, trigger a cluster update.

During cluster updates, the Admin Console can experience downtime and become unavailable if the Kubernetes version is updated. If you’re already viewing the Admin Console when the downtime occurs, you will see a message informing you that a cluster update is in progress and that the connection will resume once the Admin Console is available again:

<img alt="Embedded cluster update in progress modal" src="/images/embedded-cluster-update-in-progress.png" width="400px"/>

:::important
Do not downgrade the Embedded Cluster version. This is not supported but is not prohibited, and it can lead to unexpected behavior.
:::

## Access the Cluster

With Embedded Cluster, end-users are rarely supposed to need to use the CLI. Typical workflows, like updating the application and the cluster, are driven through the Admin Console.

Nonetheless, there are times when vendors or their customers need to use the CLI for development or troubleshooting.

To access the cluster and use other included binaries:

1. SSH onto a controller node.

1. Use the Embedded Cluster shell command to start a shell with access to the cluster:

     ```
     sudo ./APP_SLUG shell
     ```

     The output looks similar to the following:
     ```
        __4___
    _  \ \ \ \   Welcome to APP_SLUG debug shell.
    <'\ /_/_/_/   This terminal is now configured to access your cluster.
    ((____!___/) Type 'exit' (or CTRL+d) to exit.
    \0\0\0\0\/  Happy hacking.
    ~~~~~~~~~~~
    root@alex-ec-2:/home/alex# export KUBECONFIG="/var/lib/k0s/pki/admin.conf"
    root@alex-ec-2:/home/alex# export PATH="$PATH:/var/lib/embedded-cluster/bin"
    root@alex-ec-2:/home/alex# source <(kubectl completion bash)
    root@alex-ec-2:/home/alex# source /etc/bash_completion
    ```

     The appropriate kubeconfig is exported, and the location of useful binaries like kubectl and Replicated’s preflight and support-bundle plugins is added to PATH.

     :::note
     The shell command cannot be run on non-controller nodes.
     :::

1. Use the available binaries as needed.

     **Example**:

     ```bash
     kubectl version
     ```
     ```
     Client Version: v1.29.1
     Kustomize Version: v5.0.4-0.20230601165947-6ce0bf390ce3
     Server Version: v1.29.1+k0s
     ```

1. Type `exit` or **Ctrl + D** to exit the shell.

     :::note
     If you encounter a typical workflow where your customers have to use the Embedded Cluster shell, reach out to Alex Parker at alexp@replicated.com. These workflows might be candidates for additional Admin Console functionality.
     :::

### Troubleshoot

From the shell, you can generate a support bundle for the Embedded Cluster to help with troubleshooting.

The support bundle collects host-level information to troubleshoot failures related to host configuration like DNS, networking, or storage problems. It also collects cluster-level information about the components provided by Replicated, such as the Admin Console and Embedded Cluster operator that manage install and upgrade operations.

If the cluster hasn't installed successfully and cluster-level information is not available, it will be excluded from the bundle.

To generate a support bundle:

1. Access the Embedded Cluster shell:
     ```
     sudo ./APP_SLUG shell
     ```

2. Generate the support bundle:
     ```
     kubectl support-bundle /var/lib/embedded-cluster/support/host-support-bundle.yaml --load-cluster-specs
     ```

You can then use the support bundle for troubleshooting or provide it to Replicated for assistance.

## Manage Nodes

The section describes managing nodes in clusters created with Embedded Cluster, including how to add or reset nodes.

### Add Nodes (Alpha)

You can add nodes and create a multi-node cluster. When adding nodes, you select one or more roles for that node, depending on which roles are defined in the Embedded Cluster config. The Admin Console provides the join command you use to join nodes to the cluster.

For more information about defining node roles, see [Roles](/reference/embedded-config#roles) in _Embedded Cluster Config_.

To add nodes to a cluster:

1. In the Admin Console, click **Cluster Management** at the top.

     When initially installing the application, you are brought to this page automatically after logging into the Admin Console.

1. Click **Add node**.

1. In the **Add a Node** dialog, select one or more roles for this node. If no custom roles are defined, the role selection will not appear and only the join command will show.

     <img alt="Add node page in the Admin Console" src="/images/admin-console-add-node.png" width="600px"/>

     [View a larger version of this image](/images/admin-console-add-node.png)

1. Copy the provided join command.

     **Example:**

     ```
     sudo ./APP_SLUG join 10.128.0.43:30000 bM8DO3MNvkouz9TFK3TcFanI
     ```


1. SSH onto the machine you want to join to the cluster. Ensure that the Embedded Cluster binary is available on that node. For more information on downloading the Embedded Cluster binary, see Installing.

     :::important
     You must join nodes with the same installer that you used for the first node. If you use a different installer from a different release of your application, the cluster will not be stable.
     :::

1. Run the copied join command using the Embedded Cluster binary.

1. Check the **Cluster Management** page in the Admin Console to see the node appear and wait for the status to change to Ready.

1. Repeat the process for as many nodes as you would like to add.


### Reset a Node

Resetting a node removes the cluster and your application from that node. This is useful for iteration, development, and when mistakes are made, so you can reset a machine and reuse it instead of having to procure another machine.

If you want to completely remove a cluster, you need to reset each node individually.

When resetting a node, OpenEBS PVCs on the node are deleted. Only PVCs created as part of a StatefulSet will be recreated automatically on another node. To recreate other PVCs, the application will need to be redeployed.

To reset the node of a cluster:

1. SSH onto the machine. Ensure that the Embedded Cluster binary is still available on that machine. For more information on downloading the Embedded Cluster binary, see [Download the Embedded Cluster Binary](#download-the-embedded-cluster-binary) above.

1. Run the reset command to reset the node. The `--reboot` flag automatically reboots the machine to ensure that transient configuration is also reset.

     ```
     sudo ./APP_SLUG reset --reboot
     ```

     :::note
     Pass the `--no-prompt` flag to disable interactive prompts. Pass the `--force` flag to ignore any errors encountered during the reset.
     :::

## Additional Use Cases

This section outlines some additional use cases for Embedded Cluster. These are not officially supported features from Replicated, but are ways of using Embedded Cluster that we or our customers have experimented with that might be useful to you.

### NVIDIA GPU Operator

The NVIDIA GPU Operator uses the operator framework within Kubernetes to automate the management of all NVIDIA software components needed to provision GPUs. For more information about this operator, see the [NVIDIA GPU Operator](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/gpu-operator/latest/overview.html) documentation. You can include the operator in your release as an additional Helm chart, or using the Embedded Cluster Helm extensions. For information about Helm extensions, see [Helm extensions](/reference/embedded-config#helm-extensions) in _Embedded Cluster Config_.

Using this operator with Embedded Cluster requires configuring the containerd options in the operator as follows:

```yaml
toolkit:
   env:
   - name: CONTAINERD_CONFIG
     value: /etc/k0s/containerd.d/nvidia.toml
   - name: CONTAINERD_SOCKET
     value: /run/k0s/containerd.sock
```
