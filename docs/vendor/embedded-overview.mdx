## Overview

<EmbeddedCluster/>

The following diagram demonstrates how Kubernetes and an application are installed into a customer environment using Embedded Cluster: 

![Embedded Cluster installs an app in a customer environment](/images/embedded-cluster-install.png)

[View a larger version of this image](/images/embedded-cluster-install.png)

As shown in the diagram above, the Embedded Cluster Config is included in the application release in the Replicated Vendor Portal and is used to generate the Embedded Cluster installation assets. Users can download these installation assets from the Replicated app service (`replicated.app`) on the command line, then run the Embedded Cluster installation command to install Kubernetes and the KOTS Admin Console. Finally, users access the Admin Console to optionally add nodes to the cluster and to configure and install the application.

### Limitations

Embedded Cluster has the following limitations:

* **No automated migration from kURL**: There is no automated migration from an existing kURL instance to Embedded Cluster. For a manual migration procedure, reach out to Alex Parker at alexp@replicated.com.

* **Multi-node support is in beta**: Support for multi-node embedded clusters is in beta, and enabling high availability for multi-node clusters is in alpha. Only single-node embedded clusters are generally available. For more information, see [Add Nodes (Beta)](#add-nodes) and [Enable High Availability for Multi-Node Clusters (Alpha)](#ha) below.

* **Disaster recovery is in alpha**: Disaster Recovery for Embedded Cluster installations is in alpha. For more information, see [Disaster Recovery for Embedded Cluster (Alpha)](/vendor/embedded-disaster-recovery).

* **Rollbacks not supported**: The [`allowRollback`](/reference/custom-resource-application#allowrollback) field in the KOTS Application custom resource is not supported for Embedded Cluster installations. In Embedded Cluster installations, the application and the cluster are installed and updated together as a single appliance. Because of this, users cannot roll back (downgrade) the application to an earlier version.

* **Changing node hostnames is not supported**: After a host is added to a Kubernetes cluster, Kubernetes assumes that the hostname and IP address of the host will not change. If you need to change the hostname or IP address of a node, you must first remove the node from the cluster. For more information about the requirements for naming nodes, see [Node name uniqueness](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/#node-name-uniqueness) in the Kubernetes documentation.

* **Automated installations not supported**: Users cannot do automated (headless) Embedded Cluster installations because it is not possible to configure the application by passing the [ConfigValues](/vendor/releases-configvalues) file with the installation command. Embedded Cluster installations require that the application is configured from the Admin Console config screen. For more information about automating existing cluster or kURL installations with the KOTS CLI, see [Installing with the CLI](/enterprise/installing-existing-cluster-automation).

* **Automatic updates not supported**: Configuring automatic updates from the Admin Console so that new versions are automatically deployed is not supported for Embedded Cluster installations. For more information, see [Configuring Automatic Updates](/enterprise/updating-apps).

* **Embedded Cluster installation assets not available through the Download Portal**: The assets required to install with Embedded Cluster cannot be shared with users through the Download Portal. Users can follow the Embedded Cluster installation instructions to download and extract the installation assets. For more information, see [Online Installation with Embedded Cluster](/enterprise/installing-embedded).

* **`minKotsVersion` and `targetKotsVersion` not supported**: The [`minKotsVersion`](/reference/custom-resource-application#minkotsversion-beta) and [`targetKotsVersion`](/reference/custom-resource-application#targetkotsversion) fields in the KOTS Application custom resource are not supported for Embedded Cluster installations. This is because each version of Embedded Cluster includes a particular version of KOTS. Setting `targetKotsVersion` or `minKotsVersion` to a version of KOTS that does not coincide with the version that is included in the specified version of Embedded Cluster will cause Embedded Cluster installations to fail with an error message like: `Error: This version of App Name requires a different version of KOTS from what you currently have installed`. To avoid installation failures, do not use targetKotsVersion or minKotsVersion in releases that support installation with Embedded Cluster.

* **Support bundles over 100MB in the Admin Console**: Support bundles are stored in rqlite. Bundles over 100MB could cause rqlite to crash, causing errors in the installation. You can still generate a support bundle with the CLI following the instructions [here](/vendor/embedded-overview#troubleshoot).

* **Kubernetes version template functions not supported**: The KOTS [KubernetesVersion](/reference/template-functions-static-context#kubernetesversion), [KubernetesMajorVersion](/reference/template-functions-static-context#kubernetesmajorversion), and [KubernetesMinorVersion](/reference/template-functions-static-context#kubernetesminorversion) template functions do not provide accurate Kubernetes version information for Embedded Cluster installations. This is because these template functions are rendered before the Kubernetes cluster has been updated to the intended version. However, `KubernetesVersion` is not necessary for Embedded Cluster because vendors specify the Embedded Cluster version, which includes a known Kubernetes version.

* **Custom domains not supported**: Embedded Cluster does not support the use of custom domains, even if custom domains are configured. We intend to add support for custom domains. For more information about custom domains, see [About Custom Domains](/vendor/custom-domains). 

* **KOTS Auto-GitOps workflow not supported**: Embedded Cluster does not support the KOTS Auto-GitOps workflow. If an end-user is interested in GitOps, consider the Helm install method instead. For more information, see [Installing with Helm](/vendor/install-with-helm).

* **Downgrading Kubernetes not supported**: Embedded Cluster does not support downgrading Kubernetes. The admin console will not prevent end-users from attempting to downgrade Kubernetes if a more recent version of your application specifies a previous Embedded Cluster version. You must ensure that you do not promote new versions with previous Embedded Cluster versions.

* **Templating not supported in Embedded Cluster Config**: The [Embedded Cluster Config](/reference/embedded-config) resource does not support the use of Go template functions, including [KOTS template functions](/reference/template-functions-about).

## Quick Start

You can use the following steps to get started quickly with Embedded Cluster. More detailed documentation is available below.

1. Create a new customer or edit an existing customer and select the **Embedded Cluster Enabled** license option. Save the customer.

1. Create a new release that includes your application. In that release, create an Embedded Cluster Config that includes, at minimum, the Embedded Cluster version you want to use. See the Embedded Cluster [GitHub repo](https://github.com/replicatedhq/embedded-cluster/releases) to find the latest version.

     Example Embedded Cluster Config:

     <EcConfig/>

1. Save the release and promote it to the channel the customer is assigned to.

1. Return to the customer page where you enabled Embedded Cluster. At the top right, click **Install instructions** and choose **Embedded Cluster**. A dialog appears with instructions on how to download the Embedded Cluster installation assets and install your application.

     ![Customer install instructions drop down button](/images/customer-install-instructions-dropdown.png)

     [View a larger version of this image](/images/customer-install-instructions-dropdown.png)
 
1. On your VM, run the commands in the **Embedded Cluster install instructions** dialog.

     <img alt="Embedded cluster install instruction dialog" src="/images/embedded-cluster-install-dialog-latest.png" width="550px"/>

     [View a larger version of this image](/images/embedded-cluster-install-dialog-latest.png)

1. Enter an Admin Console password when prompted.

     The Admin Console URL is printed when the installation finishes. Access the Admin Console to begin installing your application. During the installation process in the Admin Console, you have the opportunity to add nodes if you want a multi-node cluster. Then you can provide application config, run preflights, and deploy your application.

## About Configuring Embedded Cluster

To install an application with Embedded Cluster, an Embedded Cluster Config must be present in the application release. The Embedded Cluster Config lets you define several characteristics about the cluster that will be created.

For more information, see [Embedded Cluster Config](/reference/embedded-config).

## About Installing with Embedded Cluster

This section provides an overview of installing applications with Embedded Cluster.

### Installation Options

Embedded Cluster supports installations in online (internet-connected) environments and air gap environments with no outbound internet access.

For online installations, Embedded Cluster also supports installing behind a proxy server.

For more information about how to install with Embedded Cluster, see:
* [Online Installation wtih Embedded Cluster](/enterprise/installing-embedded)
* [Air Gap Installation with Embedded Cluster](/enterprise/installing-embedded-air-gap)

### Customer-Specific Installation Instructions

To install with Embedded Cluster, you can follow the customer-specific instructions provided on the **Customer** page in the Vendor Portal. For example:

<img alt="Embedded cluster install instruction dialog" src="/images/embedded-cluster-install-dialog.png" width="500px"/>

[View a larger version of this image](/images/embedded-cluster-install-dialog.png)

### About Host Preflight Checks

During installation, Embedded Cluster automatically runs a default set of _host preflight checks_. The default host preflight checks are designed to verify that the installation environment meets the requirements for Embedded Cluster, such as:
* The system has sufficient disk space
* The system has at least 2G of memory and 2 CPU cores
* The system clock is synchronized

For Embedded Cluster requirements, see [Requirements](#requirements). For the full default host preflight spec for Embedded Cluster, see [`host-preflight.yaml`](https://github.com/replicatedhq/embedded-cluster/blob/main/pkg/preflights/host-preflight.yaml) in the `embedded-cluster` repository in GitHub.

If any of the host preflight checks fail, installation is blocked and a message describing the failure is displayed. For more information about host preflight checks for installations on VMs or bare metal servers, see [About Host Preflights](preflight-support-bundle-about#host-preflights).

#### Limitations

Embedded Cluster host preflight checks have the following limitations:

* The default host preflight checks for Embedded Cluster cannot be modified, and vendors cannot provide their own custom host preflight spec for Embedded Cluster.
* Host preflight checks do not check that any application-specific requirements are met. For more information about defining preflight checks for your application, see [Defining Preflight Checks](/vendor/preflight-defining).

#### Skip Host Preflight Checks

You can skip host preflight checks by passing the `--skip-host-preflights` flag with the Embedded Cluster `install` command. For example:

```bash
sudo ./my-app install --license license.yaml --skip-host-preflights
```

When you skip host preflight checks, the Admin Console still runs any application-specific preflight checks that are defined in the release before the application is deployed.

:::note
Skipping host preflight checks is _not_ recommended for production installations.

## About Managing Nodes with Embedded Cluster

This section describes managing nodes in clusters created with Embedded Cluster.

### Ading Nodes

Users can add nodes to a cluster with Embedded Cluster from the Admin Console. The Admin Console provides the join command used to add nodes to the cluster.

For more information, see [Adding and Managing Nodes with Embedded Cluster](/enterprise/embedded-manage-nodes).

### Defining Node Roles

You can define node roles in the Embedded Cluster Config. In multi-node clusters, roles are used to determine which nodes run the Kubernetes control plane, and to assign application workloads to particular nodes. Users can then select and assign one or more roles to a node when it is joined to the cluster.

For more information, see [roles](/reference/embedded-config#roles) in _Embedded Cluster Config_.

### High Availability for Multi-Node Clusters (Alpha)

Multi-node clusters are not highly available by default. After three controller nodes are present in the cluster, high availability (HA) can be enabled.

For more information about creating HA multi-node clusters with Embedded Cluster, see [Enable High Availability for Multi-Node Clusters (Alpha)](/enterprise/embedded-manage-nodes#ha) in _Adding and Managing Nodes with Embedded Cluster_.

## (Optional) Serve Installation Assets Using the Vendor API

To install with Embedded Cluster, you need to download the Embedded Cluster installer binary and a license. Air gap installations also require an air gap bundle. Some vendors already have a portal where their customers can log in to access documentation or download artifacts. In cases like this, you can serve the Embedded Cluster installation essets yourself using the Replicated Vendor API, rather than having customers download the assets from the Replicated app service using a curl command during installation.

To serve Embedded Cluster installation assets with the Vendor API:

1. If you have not done so already, create an API token for the Vendor API. See [Using the Vendor API v3](/reference/vendor-api-using#api-token-requirement).

1. Call the [Get an Embedded Cluster release](https://replicated-vendor-api.readme.io/reference/getembeddedclusterrelease) endpoint to download the assets needed to install your application with Embedded Cluster. Your customers must take this binary and their license and copy them to the machine where they will install your application.

     Note the following:

     * (Recommended) Provide the `customerId` query parameter so that the customer’s license is included in the downloaded tarball. This mirrors what is returned when a customer downloads the binary directly using the Replicated app service and is the most useful option. Excluding the `customerId` is useful if you plan to distribute the license separately.

     * If you do not provide any query parameters, this endpoint downloads the Embedded Cluster binary for the latest release on the specified channel. You can provide the `channelSequence` query parameter to download the binary for a particular release.

## About Performing Updates with Embedded Cluster

<UpdateOverview/>

For more information about updating, see [Performing Updates with Embedded Cluster](/enterprise/updating-embedded).

## Access the Cluster

With Embedded Cluster, end-users are rarely supposed to need to use the CLI. Typical workflows, like updating the application and the cluster, are driven through the Admin Console.

Nonetheless, there are times when vendors or their customers need to use the CLI for development or troubleshooting.

To access the cluster and use other included binaries:

1. SSH onto a controller node.

1. Use the Embedded Cluster shell command to start a shell with access to the cluster:

     ```
     sudo ./APP_SLUG shell
     ```

     The output looks similar to the following:
     ```
        __4___
    _  \ \ \ \   Welcome to APP_SLUG debug shell.
    <'\ /_/_/_/   This terminal is now configured to access your cluster.
    ((____!___/) Type 'exit' (or CTRL+d) to exit.
    \0\0\0\0\/  Happy hacking.
    ~~~~~~~~~~~
    root@alex-ec-2:/home/alex# export KUBECONFIG="/var/lib/embedded-cluster/k0s/pki/admin.conf"
    root@alex-ec-2:/home/alex# export PATH="$PATH:/var/lib/embedded-cluster/bin"
    root@alex-ec-2:/home/alex# source <(kubectl completion bash)
    root@alex-ec-2:/home/alex# source /etc/bash_completion
    ```

     The appropriate kubeconfig is exported, and the location of useful binaries like kubectl and Replicated’s preflight and support-bundle plugins is added to PATH.

     :::note
     You cannot run the `shell` command on worker nodes.
     :::

1. Use the available binaries as needed.

     **Example**:

     ```bash
     kubectl version
     ```
     ```
     Client Version: v1.29.1
     Kustomize Version: v5.0.4-0.20230601165947-6ce0bf390ce3
     Server Version: v1.29.1+k0s
     ```

1. Type `exit` or **Ctrl + D** to exit the shell.

     :::note
     If you encounter a typical workflow where your customers have to use the Embedded Cluster shell, reach out to Alex Parker at alexp@replicated.com. These workflows might be candidates for additional Admin Console functionality.
     :::

### Troubleshoot

From the shell, you can generate a support bundle for Replicated Embedded Cluster installations to help with troubleshooting.

The default support bundle spec for Embedded Cluster collects host-level information to troubleshoot failures related to host configuration like DNS, networking, or storage problems.

It also collects cluster-level information about the components provided by Replicated, such as the Admin Console and Embedded Cluster operator that manage install and upgrade operations. If the cluster has not installed successfully and cluster-level information is not available, it will be excluded from the bundle.

When generating the default host bundle for Embedded Cluster installations, you can also use the `--load-cluster-specs` flag to automatically discover all support bundle specs that are defined in Secrets or ConfigMaps in the cluster. This ensures that any application-specific specs are included in the bundle. For more information, see [Discover Cluster Specs](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/support-bundle/discover-cluster-specs/) in the Troubleshoot documentation.

<EmbeddedClusterSupportBundle/>

You can then use the support bundle for troubleshooting or provide it to Replicated for assistance.

## Additional Use Cases

This section outlines some additional use cases for Embedded Cluster. These are not officially supported features from Replicated, but are ways of using Embedded Cluster that we or our customers have experimented with that might be useful to you.

### NVIDIA GPU Operator

The NVIDIA GPU Operator uses the operator framework within Kubernetes to automate the management of all NVIDIA software components needed to provision GPUs. For more information about this operator, see the [NVIDIA GPU Operator](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/gpu-operator/latest/overview.html) documentation. You can include the operator in your release as an additional Helm chart, or using the Embedded Cluster Helm extensions. For information about Helm extensions, see [extensions](/reference/embedded-config#extensions) in _Embedded Cluster Config_.

Using this operator with Embedded Cluster requires configuring the containerd options in the operator as follows:

```yaml
toolkit:
   env:
   - name: CONTAINERD_CONFIG
     value: /etc/k0s/containerd.d/nvidia.toml
   - name: CONTAINERD_SOCKET
     value: /run/k0s/containerd.sock
```
