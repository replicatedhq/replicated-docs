# Creating and Promoting Releases

You can use the Replicated vendor portal to create and promote versions of your application to various release channels.

## Prerequisite

If you are using a private registry or the Replicated private registry, you must connect to the registry before creating a release. For more information, see [How to Package and Distribute a Production Application](distributing-workflow.mdx).

## Create and Promote a Release

To create and promote a release in the vendor portal:

1. From the Applications dropdown list, select **Create an app** or select an existing release.

1. Click **Releases** on the left menu, and then click **Create release**.

  A YAML editor displays.

1. If you are creating a new application, drag and drop your application files into the file directory of the YAML editor. These can be Kubernetes manifest files or Helm charts.

1. Edit the YAML files as needed. Promote and test the changes after each iteration. The following table gives a suggested iteration order, but you can configure these functions in any order. These functions can be used with Kubernetes Operators, except where noted.
 and iterate after each update.

1. Click **Save release**, and click **Promote**.

1. In the Promote Release dialog, edit the fields:

    ![Promote release dialog](/images/release-promote.png)

    * **Channel**: Select the channel where you want to promote the release. The defaults are Stable, Beta, and Unstable. If you created custom channels, they are listed here also.
    * **Version label**: Enter a version label. If semantic versioning is enabled for the channel, you must use a valid semantic version. For more information, see [Enabling Semantic Versioning](releases-semantic-versioning).
    * **Requirements**: Select **Prevent this release from being skipped during upgrades** to mark the release as required. When a release is required, the admin console requires users to upgrade to that version before they can upgrade to a later version. For example, if you select **Prevent this release from being skipped during upgrades** for release v2.0.0, users with v1.0.0 deployed must upgrade to v2.0.0 before they can upgrade to a version later than v2.0.0, such as v2.1.0.

      :::note
      Required releases are supported in the app manager v1.68.0 and later.

      After users deploy a required version, they can no longer redeploy, or _roll back_ to, versions earlier than the required version, even if `allowRollback` is `true` in the Application custom resource manifest. For more information about rollbacks, see [allowRollback](../reference/custom-resource-application#allowrollback) in the _Application_ custom resource topic.
      :::

    * **Release notes**: Add detailed release notes. The release notes support markdown and are shown to your customer.

1. Click **Promote**.

  The release displays as active on the Releases page.
