# Install with Helm

This topic describes how to use Helm to install releases that contain one or more Helm charts. For more information about the `helm install` command, including how to override values in a chart during installation, see [Helm Install](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_install/) in the Helm documentation.

## Prerequisites

Before you install, complete the following prerequisites:

* The customer record in the Vendor Portal must have a valid email address. This email address is only used as a username for the Replicated registry and is never contacted. For more information about adding an email address for a customer, see [Creating a Customer](/vendor/releases-creating-customer).

* The customer must have the **Existing Cluster (Helm CLI)** install type enabled. For more information about enabling install types for customers in the Vendor Portal, see [Manage Install Types for a License](licenses-install-types).

* Create an image pull secret for the proxy registry and add it to your Helm chart. This ensures that the Replicated proxy registry can be used to grant proxy access to your application images for Helm CLI installations. To create the image pull secret and add it to your Helm chart, follow the steps in [Use the Proxy Registry with Helm CLI Installations](/vendor/helm-image-registry).

* Declare the Replicated SDK as a dependency in your Helm chart. For more information, see [Install the SDK as a Subchart](replicated-sdk-installing#install-the-sdk-as-a-subchart) in _Installing the Replicated SDK_.

* If the [Security Center (Alpha)](/vendor/security-center-about) is enabled for your account, add a unique HelmChart custom resource for each Helm chart in your release. The HelmChart custom resource is required to create the list of images that are scanned and reported on in the Security Center.

    The following is an example HelmChart custom resource for a chart named `examplechart` with a chart version of `1.0.0`:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: kots.io/v1beta2
    kind: HelmChart
    metadata:
      name: examplechart
    spec:
      chart:
        # name must match the name of the chart
        name: examplechart
        # chartVersion must match the version of the chart
        chartVersion: 1.0.0
    ```
    For more information about the HelmChart custom resource, see [HelmChart v2](/reference/custom-resource-helmchart-v2).

&#42; Required only if the [Replicated SDK](/vendor/replicated-sdk-overview) is included as a dependency of the application Helm chart.

## Install

To install a Helm chart:

1. In the Vendor Portal, go to **Customers** and click on the target customer.

1. Click **Helm install instructions**.

     [View a larger image](/images/helm-install-button.png)

     :::note
     Helm charts marked with the `kots.io/installer-only: "true"` annotation will not appear in the Helm install instructions. These charts are deployed only when using Replicated installers (Embedded Cluster, KOTS, and kURL). For more information, see [HelmChart v2](/reference/custom-resource-helmchart-v2).
     :::

1. In the **Helm install instructions** dialog, run the first command to log in to the Replicated registry:

     ```bash
     helm registry login registry.replicated.com --username EMAIL_ADDRESS --password LICENSE_ID
     ```
     Where:
     * `EMAIL_ADDRESS` is the customer's email address
     * `LICENSE_ID` is the ID of the customer's license

     :::note
     You can safely ignore the following warning message: `WARNING: Using --password via the CLI is insecure.` This message is displayed because using the `--password` flag stores the password in bash history. This login method is not insecure.

     Alternatively, to avoid the warning message, you can click **(show advanced)** in the **Helm install instructions** dialog to display a login command that excludes the `--password` flag. With the advanced login command, you are prompted for the password after running the command.  
     :::

1. (Optional) Run the second and third commands to install the preflight plugin and run preflight checks. If no preflight checks are defined, these commands are not displayed. For more information about defining and running preflight checks, see [About Preflight Checks and Support Bundles](preflight-support-bundle-about).

1. Run the fourth command to install using Helm:

     ```bash
     helm install RELEASE_NAME oci://registry.replicated.com/APP_SLUG/CHANNEL/CHART_NAME
     ```
     Where:
     * `RELEASE_NAME` is the name of the Helm release.
     * `APP_SLUG` is the slug for the application. For information about how to find the application slug, see [Get the Application Slug](/vendor/vendor-portal-manage-app#slug).
     * `CHANNEL` is the lowercased name of the channel where the release was promoted, such as `beta` or `unstable`. Channel is not required for releases promoted to the Stable channel.
     * `CHART_NAME` is the name of the Helm chart.

     :::note
     To install the SDK with custom RBAC permissions, include the `--set` flag with the `helm install` command to override the value of the `replicated.serviceAccountName` field with a custom service account. For more information, see [Customizing RBAC for the SDK](/vendor/replicated-sdk-customizing#customize-rbac-for-the-sdk).
     :::

1. (Optional) In the Vendor Portal, click **Customers**. You can see that the customer you used to install is marked as **Active** and the details about the application instance are listed under the customer name. 

     **Example**:
