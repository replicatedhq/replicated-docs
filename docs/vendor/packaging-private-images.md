# Connecting to an External Registry

This topic describes how to add credentials for an external private registry using the Replicated Vendor Portal or Replicated CLI. Adding an external registry allows you to grant proxy access to private images using the Replicated proxy registry. For more information, see [About the Replicated Proxy Registry](private-images-about).

For information about adding a registry with the Vendor API v3, see [Create an external registry with the specified parameters](https://replicated-vendor-api.readme.io/reference/createexternalregistry) in the Vendor API v3 documentation.

## Supported Registries

Replicated recommends that application vendors use one the following external private registries:

* Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)
* DockerHub
* GitHub Container Registry
* Google Artifact Registry
* Google Container Registry (Deprecated)
* Sonatype Nexus 
* Quay.io

These registries have been tested for compatibility with KOTS.

You can also configure access to most other external registries if the registry conforms to the Open Container Initiative (OCI) standard. 

## Add Credentials for an External Registry

All applications in your team have access to the external registry that you add. This means that you can use the images in the external registry across multiple apps in the same team.

### Using the Vendor Portal

To add an external registry using the Vendor Portal:

1. Log in to the [Vendor Portal](https://vendor.replicated.com) and go to the **Images** page.
1. Click **Add External Registry**.

1. In the **Provider** drop-down, select your registry provider. 

1. Complete the fields in the dialog, depending on the provider that you chose:

   :::note
   Replicated stores your credentials encrypted and securely. Your credentials and the encryption key do not leave Replicated servers.

1. For **Image name & tag**, enter the image name and image tag and click **Test** to confirm that the Vendor Portal can access the image. For example, `api:v1.0.1` or `my-app/api:v1.01`.

1. Click **Link registry**.

### Using the CLI

To configure access to private images in an external registry using the Replicated CLI:

1. Install and configure the Replicated CLI. See [Installing the Replicated CLI](/reference/replicated-cli-installing).

1. Run the `registry add` command for your external private registry. For more information about the `registry add` command, see [registry add](/reference/replicated-cli-registry-add) in _Replicated CLI_.

   For example, to add a DockerHub registry:

   ```bash
   replicated registry add dockerhub --username USERNAME \
     --password PASSWORD
   ```
  
   Where:
   * `USERNAME` is the username for DockerHub credentials with access to the registry.
   * `PASSWORD` is the password for DockerHub credentials with access to the registry.

   :::note
   To prevent the password from being saved in your shell history, Replicated recommends that you use the `--password-stdin` flag and entering the password when prompted.
   :::

## Test External Registry Credentials

Replicated recommends that you test external registry credentials to ensure that the saved credentials on Replicated servers can pull the specified image.

To validate that the configured registry can pull specific images:

```bash
replicated registry test HOSTNAME \
    --image IMAGE_NAME
```

Where:
* `HOSTNAME` is the name of the host, such as `index.docker.io`.
* `IMAGE_NAME` is the name of the target image in the registry.

For example:

```bash
replicated registry test index.docker.io --image my-company/my-image:v1.2.3
```
