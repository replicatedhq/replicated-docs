# Using the Proxy Registry with Helm Installations

This topic describes how to use the Replicated proxy registry to proxy images for installations with the Helm CLI. For more information about the proxy registry, see [About the Replicated Proxy Registry](private-images-about).

## Overview

With the Replicated proxy registry, each customer's unique license can grant proxy access to images in an external private registry.

During Helm installations, after customers provide their license ID, a `global.replicated.dockerconfigjson` field that contains a base64 encoded Docker configuration file is automatically injected in the Helm chart values. You can use this `global.replicated.dockerconfigjson` field to create the pull secret required to authenticate with the proxy registry.

## Pull Private Images Through the Proxy Registry in Helm Installations

To use the Replicated proxy registry for applications installed with Helm:

1. <StepCreds/>

1. <StepCustomDomain/>

1. In your Helm chart values file, set your image repository URL to the location of the image on the proxy registry. If you added a custom domain, use your custom domain. Otherwise, use `proxy.replicated.com`.

      The proxy registry URL has the following format: `DOMAIN/proxy/APP_SLUG/EXTERNAL_REGISTRY_IMAGE_URL`
      
      Where:
      * `DOMAIN` is either `proxy.replicated.com` or your custom domain.
      * `APP_SLUG` is the unique slug of your application.
      * `EXTERNAL_REGISTRY_IMAGE_URL` is the path to the private image on your external registry.
      
      **Example with proxy.replicated.com:**

      ```yaml
      # values.yaml
      api:
        image:
          registry: ghcr.io
          repository: proxy/app/ghcr.io/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg
          tag: catalog-1.24.0
      ```

1. Ensure that any references to the image in your Helm chart access the field from your values file.  

   **Example**:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: api 
      # Access the registry, repository, and tag fields from the values file
            image: {{ .Values.images.api.registry }}/{{ .Values.images.api.repository }}:{{ .Values.images.api.tag }}
    ```

1. In your Helm chart templates, create a Kubernetes Secret to evaluate if the `global.replicated.dockerconfigjson` value is set and then write the rendered value into a Secret on the cluster, as shown below.

   This Secret is used to authenticate with the proxy registry. For information about how Kubernetes uses the `kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson` Secret type to provide authentication for a private registry, see [Pull an Image from a Private Registry](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/) in the Kubernetes documentation. 

   :::note
   Do not use `replicated` for the name of the image pull secret because the Replicated SDK automatically creates a Secret named `replicated`. Using the same name causes an error.
   :::

   ```yaml
   # templates/replicated-pull-secret.yaml

   {{ if .Values.global.replicated.dockerconfigjson }}
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   metadata:
     # Note: Do not use "replicated" for the name of the pull secret
     name: replicated-pull-secret
   type: kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
   data:
     .dockerconfigjson: {{ .Values.global.replicated.dockerconfigjson }}
   {{ end }}
   ```
   

1. Add the image pull secret that you created to any manifests that reference the image:

   **Example:**

    ```yaml
    # templates/deployment.yaml

    image: "{{ .Values.images.your-app.apiImageRepository }}:{{ .Values.images.your-app.apiImageTag }}"
    # Add the pull secret
    {{ if .Values.global.replicated.dockerconfigjson }}
    imagePullSecrets:
      - name: replicated-pull-secret
    {{ end }}
    name: your-app
    ports:
    - containerPort: 3000
      name: http
    ```

1. Package your Helm chart and add it to a release. Promote the release to a development channel. See [Managing Releases with Vendor Portal](releases-creating-releases).

1. Install in a development environment to test your changes. See [Installing with Helm](/vendor/install-with-helm).
