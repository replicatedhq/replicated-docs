# Use the Proxy Registry with Helm CLI Installations

This topic describes how to configure your application to use the Replicated proxy registry with Helm CLI installations. For more information about the proxy registry, see [About the Replicated Proxy Registry](private-images-about). For more information about installing applications distributed with Replicated using Helm, see [About Helm Installations with Replicated](/vendor/helm-install-overview).

## Overview

During Helm CLI installations with Replicated, after customers provide their unique license ID, a `global.replicated.dockerconfigjson` field that contains a base64 encoded Docker configuration file is automatically injected in the Helm chart values.

You can use this `global.replicated.dockerconfigjson` field to create the pull secret required to authenticate with the proxy registry. For more information about how Kubernetes uses the `kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson` Secret type to provide authentication for a private registry, see [Pull an Image from a Private Registry](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/) in the Kubernetes documentation.

:::note
For Helm charts that include the Replicated SDK as a dependency, the image used by the Replicated SDK is automatically proxied through the proxy registry. No additional configuration is required. For more information, see [About the Replicated SDK](/vendor/replicated-sdk-overview).

## Configure Your Application to Use the Proxy Registry

To configure your application to use the proxy registry with Helm CLI installations:

1. <StepCreds/>

1. <StepCustomDomain/>

1. <RewriteHelmValues/>

1. In your Helm chart templates, add a YAML file that evaluates if the `global.replicated.dockerconfigjson` value is set, and then writes the rendered value into a Secret on the cluster, as shown below.

   :::note
   Do not use `replicated` for the name of the image pull secret because the Replicated SDK automatically creates a Secret named `replicated`. Using the same name causes an error.
   :::

   ```yaml
   # templates/replicated-pull-secret.yaml

   {{ if .Values.global.replicated.dockerconfigjson }}
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   metadata:
     # Note: Do not use "replicated" for the name of the pull secret
     name: replicated-pull-secret
   type: kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
   data:
     .dockerconfigjson: {{ .Values.global.replicated.dockerconfigjson }}
   {{ end }}
   ```
   
1. Add the image pull secret that you created to any manifests that reference the image.

   **Example:**

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: api 
      # Access the registry, repository, and tag fields from the values file
            image: {{ .Values.images.api.registry }}/{{ .Values.images.api.repository }}:{{ .Values.images.api.tag }}
            # Add the pull secret
            {{ if .Values.global.replicated.dockerconfigjson }}
            imagePullSecrets:
              - name: replicated-pull-secret
            {{ end }}
    ```

1. Package your Helm chart and add it to a release. Promote the release to a development channel. See [Managing Releases with Vendor Portal](releases-creating-releases).

1. Install in a development environment to test your changes. See [Install with Helm](/vendor/install-with-helm).
