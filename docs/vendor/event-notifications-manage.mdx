:::note

:::

This topic describes how to view, edit, disable, and delete event notifications in the Replicated Vendor Portal.

## Overview

The Notifications page in the Vendor Portal provides visibility into your notification subscriptions and, optionally, team subscriptions, as well as a complete history of notification events. You can manage your own subscriptions and, if you have the appropriate permissions, view and manage team subscriptions.

## Viewing Notification Subscriptions

The Notifications page provides two main views:

### Overview

Shows your notification subscriptions. You can optionally include team notifications using the **Show team notifications** checkbox.

To view notification subscriptions:

1. Navigate to **Notifications** in the Vendor Portal.
2. The **Overview** tab displays your active and inactive subscriptions.
3. (Optional) Select the **Show team notifications** checkbox to include notifications created by other team members.
4. (Optional) Use the search bar to filter subscriptions by name or event type.

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot of Overview view -->

Each subscription card displays the delivery channel (email or webhook), the delivery address, the date created, and who created it. If a custom name is set, it appears as the card title.

**Permissions:**
- **Team admins** can manage (edit/delete) any team member's notifications
- **Non-admin users** can view team notifications but cannot modify subscriptions created by others

### History

Shows all triggered notification events for the selected time period. You can filter the history to show only your notifications or filter by a specific notification, including deleted subscriptions.

To view notification history:

1. Navigate to **Notifications** in the Vendor Portal
2. Select the **History** tab
3. Use the filters to narrow results:
   - Filter by time period
   - Filter to "My Notifications Only"
   - Filter to a specific notification (active or deleted)

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot of History view -->

## Viewing Notification Event Details

Each notification event in the history view can be expanded to show detailed information:

To view event details:

1. Navigate to **Notifications** > **History**
2. Find the event you want to inspect
3. Click to expand the event row

Event details include:
- List of all events that matched this notification's filters
- Timestamp when each event occurred
- Event details (customer, instance, application, etc.)
- Delivery status (Sent, Failed, Pending)
- For failures: Error message explaining why delivery failed

This information is helpful for troubleshooting notification delivery issues and understanding which events are triggering your subscriptions.

## Editing an Existing Notification

To modify a notification:

1. Navigate to **Notifications** in the Vendor Portal

2. Find the notification you want to edit in the list. Select the **Show team notifications** checkbox if the notification was created by another team member.

3. Click the **Edit** icon or **Edit** button for that notification

4. The notification form opens with all current settings populated

5. Make your desired changes:
   - Add or update a custom subscription name to help identify the subscription
   - Add or remove event types, or modify filters on existing event types to broaden or narrow the scope
   - Change the delivery method or destination
   - Check or uncheck the **Enable this notification** checkbox to pause or unpause the notification

6. Click **Save Changes** to update

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot of Edit notification form -->

**Important notes:**
- Editing a notification does not affect past events already sent
- Changes apply immediately to future events
- You can only edit notifications you created, unless you are a team admin with permissions to manage all team notifications

## Disable a Notification

To temporarily stop a notification without deleting it:

1. Navigate to **Notifications** in the Vendor Portal
2. Find the notification in the list
3. Click the **Edit** button
4. Uncheck the **Enable this notification** checkbox at the bottom of the form
5. Save your changes

When a notification is disabled:
- It stops triggering for new events
- The subscription configuration is preserved
- Historical event data remains available
- You can re-enable it at any time by editing and checking the **Enable this notification** checkbox

## Deleting an Existing Notification

To permanently remove a notification:

1. Navigate to **Notifications** in the Vendor Portal

2. Find the notification you want to delete in the list

3. Click the **Delete** icon or **"Delete"** button for that notification

4. Confirm the deletion in the prompt

5. The notification is permanently removed

**Important notes:**
- Deleting a notification is permanent and cannot be undone
- No further notifications will be sent for this subscription
- Historical event data for the notification is preserved and remains viewable in the History view
- You can only delete notifications you created, unless you're a team admin

## Viewing Event History for a Specific Notification

Each notification maintains a history of when it triggered and what events matched:

1. Navigate to **Notifications** in the Vendor Portal
2. Find the notification in the list. Select the **Show team notifications** checkbox if the notification was created by another team member.
3. Click the **"View History"** button for that notification

This filtered view shows only events that matched this specific notification, making it easier to understand the notification's behavior and troubleshoot any issues.

## Troubleshoot Notification Delivery

### Viewing Delivery Status

To check if notifications are being delivered successfully:

1. Navigate to **Notifications** > **History**
2. Look at the **Delivery Status** column for each event:
   - **Sent**: Notification was successfully delivered
   - **Failed**: Delivery failed (expand row to see error message)
   - **Pending**: Delivery is in progress or queued

### Common Delivery Issues

**Email not verified:**
- Check if the email address requires verification
- Look for a verification email in your inbox
- Edit the notification to enter the verification code

**Filters too restrictive:**
- Review your filter configuration
- Check that events are actually matching your criteria
- Temporarily broaden filters to test

**Webhook endpoint issues:**
- Verify webhook URL is correct and accessible
- Check that your endpoint returns 2xx status codes
- See [Event Notification Webhooks (Beta)](event-notifications-webhooks) for webhook troubleshooting

**RBAC permissions:**
- Verify you have the necessary permissions to create and manage notifications
- Contact your team admin if you need additional permissions
