# Manage Customer Access to the Enterprise Portal

This topic describes how to control customer access to the Enterprise Portal from the Replicated Vendor Portal.

For information about how your end customers can manage, invite, and remove team members in their Enterprise Portal, see [Log In To and Use the Enterprise Portal](enterprise-portal-use).

## Manage Customer Access to the Enterprise Portal {#manage-ep-access}

You can enable and disable access to the Enterprise Portal for all customers, or on a per-customer basis. When access to the Enterprise Portal is disabled, the customer has access to the Replicated Download Portal instead.

:::note
The Entprise Portal supports Embedded Cluster and Helm CLI installation methods only. Customers that use KOTS in an existing cluster or kURL can continue to use the Download Portal. 
:::

To control customer access to the Enterprise Portal:

* In the Vendor Portal, do one of the following to enable or disable Enterprise Portal access for your customers:
   
   * Go to **Enterprise Portal > Customer Access**. For **Portal access**, enable or disable the toggle to control if all customers have access to the Enterprise Portal or the Download Portal.

## Enable SAML Authentication (Alpha) {#enable-saml}

:::note
SAML Authentication to the Enterprise Portal is Alpha and subject to change. To access this feature, a feature flag must be enabled for your team. For more information, reach out to your Replicated account representative.
:::

You can enable and disable SAML authentication for the Enterprise Portal on a per customer basis. When SAML authentication is enabled, the customer can set up SAML SSO logins for the Enterprise Portal using their identity provider (IdP). When SAML authentication is disabled, Enterprise Portal users are not able  to log in using SAML, even if the customer had already configured SAML for their Enterprise Portal previously. For more information, see [About SAML Logins (Alpha)](enterprise-portal-use#about-saml) in _Log In and Use the Enterprise Portal_.

To enable SAML authentication:

1. In the Vendor Portal, go to **Customers** and select the target customer.

1. On the customer's page, go to **Enterprise Portal access**. In the **Authentication** section, enable the **SAML Authentication** toggle.
