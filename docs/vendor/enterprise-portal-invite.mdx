## Enable or Disable Customer Access to the Enterprise Portal {#enable-disable-ep-access}

To control customer access to the Enterprise Portal:

* In the Vendor Portal, do one of the following to manage Enterprise Portal access for your customers:
   * **Enable or disable Enterprise Portal access for all customers**: Go to **Enterprise Portal > Access**. For **Portal access**, enable or disable the toggle to control if all customers have access to the Enterprise Portal or the Download Portal.
   * **Enable or disable Enterprise Portal access per customer**: Go to **Customers** and select the target customer. On the customer's page, go to **Manage Enterprise Portal Access** and enable or disable the **Enterprise Portal access** toggle to control if the customer has access to the Enterprise Portal or the Download Portal.
