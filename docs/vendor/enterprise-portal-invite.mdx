## Manage Customer Access to the Enterprise Portal {#manage-ep-access}

You can enable and disable access to the Enterprise Portal for all customers, or on a per-customer basis. When access to the Enterprise Portal is disabled, the customer has access to the Replicated Download Portal instead.

:::note
The Entprise Portal supports Embedded Cluster and Helm CLI installation methods only. Customers that use KOTS in an existing cluster or kURL can continue to use the Download Portal.
