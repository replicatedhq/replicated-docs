* In the Vendor Portal, do one of the following to enable or disable Enterprise Portal access for your customers:
   
   * Go to **Enterprise Portal > Access**. For **Portal access**, enable or disable the toggle to control if all customers have access to the Enterprise Portal or the Download Portal.
