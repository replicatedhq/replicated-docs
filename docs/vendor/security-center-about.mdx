## Overview

The Security Center helps you strengthen security enablement in your application delivery process by making it easier for both you and your enterprise customers to monitor security risks, assess known vulnerabilities, and view security information for each application release.

The Security Center is powered by Replicatedâ€™s [SecureBuild](https://securebuild.com/) product.

## Limitations
* The Security Center is Alpha. The features and functionality of the Security Center are subject to change.
* Access to the Security Center Alpha requires a feature flag be turned on for your team. For more information, reach out to your Replicated account representative.
* Security Center reporting is available only for Embedded Cluster and Helm CLI installations. It is not available for kURL installations or for KOTS installations in an existing cluster.

## Security Center Interfaces

The Security Center is accessible through the following interfaces:
* Vendor-facing dashboard available in the Replicated Vendor Portal. See [Vendor Portal](#vendor-portal) below.
* Enterprise customer-facing dashboard available in the Replicated Enterprise Portal (optionally enabled per customer license). See [Enterprise Portal](#enterprise-portal) below. 

### Vendor Portal 

The Vendor Portal Security Center gives you access to the following key security insights for your releases:
* Known vulnerabilities in container images 
* CVE details 
* A summary of top secuirty risks based on the assessed severity of the vulnerability
