# About the Security Center (Alpha)

This topic provides an overview of the Replicated Security Center.

The Security Center is Alpha. To get access to the Security Center, reach out to your Replicated account representative.

## Overview

The Security Center helps you strengthen security enablement in your application delivery process by making it easier for both you and your enterprise customers to monitor security risks, assess known vulnerabilities, and view security information for each application release.

The Security Center is powered by Replicated’s [SecureBuild](https://securebuild.com/) technology. Leveraging Grype scanning, every image is scanned continuously, not just at release time. Customers can see the same application version security information that you do, driving customer transparency, reduced security questionnaire burden, and adoption of newer, more secure versions of your application. 

Security Center intelligently filters vulnerability data based on installation type, ensuring customers only see relevant security information for their specific deployment mode as each new release is promoted to their channel. When combined with the [Replicated SDK](/vendor/replicated-sdk-overview) you gain visibility into all container images running alongside your application, helping you identify security risks and urgent upgrade needs across your customer base. 

## Requirements
* Access to the Security Center Alpha requires a feature flag be turned on for your team. For more information, reach out to your Replicated account representative.
* Display and reporting of images requires the Replicated SDK to be included as part of your release. It is recommend to use version 1.9.0 or later. 
    * If targeting a Helm CLI installation, set the Replicated SDK to [Report All Images](/vendor/replicated-sdk-customizing#report-all-images) to additionally report all container images observed in the cluster. This settting is already enabled by default for Embedded Cluster installations.
* Each Helm chart in the release must have a unique [HelmChart](/reference/custom-resource-helmchart-v2) custom resource. The HelmChart custom resource is required to create the list of images that are scanned and reported on in the Security Center. **This HelmChart custom resource requirement applies to both Helm CLI and Embedded Cluster installations.**
  
   The following is an example HelmChart custom resource for a chart named `examplechart` with a chart version of `1.0.0`:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: kots.io/v1beta2
    kind: HelmChart
    metadata:
      name: examplechart
    spec:
      chart:
        # name must match the name of the chart
        name: examplechart
        # chartVersion must match the version of the chart
        chartVersion: 1.0.0
    ```
    For more information about the HelmChart custom resource, see [HelmChart v2](/reference/custom-resource-helmchart-v2).
* When wanting to optionally include or exclude images from scanning, you must do the following:
    * If your release contains charts and resources only relevant to Embedded Cluster, and you wish to exclude these from security info shown to Helm only customers, you must mark these with an [installer-only annotation](/vendor/packaging-include-resources#installer-only).
    * If you want to include additional images you can leverage the [additionalImages field](/vendor/operator-defining-additional-images#define-additional-images-for-air-gap-bundles).

## Limitations
* The Security Center is Alpha. The features and functionality of the Security Center are subject to change.
* Security Center reporting is available only for Embedded Cluster and Helm CLI installations. It is not available for kURL installations or for KOTS installations in an existing cluster.
* If you have configured the [`builder`](/reference/custom-resource-helmchart-v2#builder) key in any of the HelmChart custom resources in your release, note that the Security Center uses the Helm values provided in the `builder` key to create the list of images that are scanned and reported on for the given Helm chart. The Security Center will scan and report on this same list of images for both air gap and online installations. If there are any images that you want reported on in the Security Center, ensure that they are exposed by the values provided in the `builder` key.

## Security Center Interfaces

The Security Center is accessible through the following interfaces:
* Vendor-facing dashboard available in the Replicated Vendor Portal. See [Vendor Portal](#vendor-portal) below.
* Enterprise customer-facing dashboard available in the Replicated Enterprise Portal (optionally enabled per customer license). See [Enterprise Portal](#enterprise-portal) below. 

### Vendor Portal 

The Vendor Portal provides comprehensive security dashboards and customer intelligence for your application:
* **Security Overview**: Real-time CVE counts across all releases with severity breakdown (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
* **Container Images**: Complete list of scanned images with vulnerability counts per image
* **CVE Details**: Detailed vulnerability information including:
  * CVE identifiers and descriptions
  * CVSS scores and severity ratings
  * Affected images and versions
  * Fixed versions (when available)

The following shows an example of the vendor-facing Security Center dashboard in the Vendor Portal:

This dashboard displays an overview of vulnerabilities present in the release for the selected channel and installation type. When a channel is selected, the information displayed is for the promoted release for that channel. 

Additionally, CVE details are available at the individual release level for all current and previously promoted application release versions. To view CVE information for a specifc release go to **Releases > [Release Version] >  Security**.

You can also view CVE details at the individual customer level for active instances. To view CVE information for a specific customer instance go to **Customers > [Customer] > [Instance] > Security**. Instances must be running the Replicated SDK verson 1.8.0 or later. 

### Enterprise Portal 

The Enterprise Portal Security Center allows you to provide key security information to your enterprise customers alongside your application releases. 

Enterprise Portal Security information can be enabled for all customers, or select customers at the license level. When enabled, your customers can see the same real-time security information you do, providing full transparency and building trust.

On the **Security Center** tab of the Enterprise Portal, for each available release version, customers can view:
* **CVE Reports**: Complete list of known vulnerabilities with severity levels
* **Container Vulnerabilities**: Per-image vulnerability breakdown
* **Upgrade Comparison**: See exactly how many CVEs are fixed by upgrading to newer versions
* **SBOM Downloads**: Software Bill of Materials in SPDX format for compliance and security audits

The following shows an example of the Security Center dashboard in the Enterprise Portal:

#### Enable the Enterprise Portal Security Center

The **Security Center** tab in the Enterprise Portal is not enabled by default. If the Security Center feature flag is enabled for your Vendor Portal team, you can optionally enable the Enterprise Portal **Security Center** tab on a per-customer basis or globally for all customers.

To enable the **Security Center** tab in a customer's Enterprise Portal, go to **Customers > [Customer] > Enterprise Portal access**.

To enable the **Security Center** tab for all customers using the Enterprise Portal, go to **Enterprise Portal > Portal Settings > Optional Features** and enable the **Enable Security Center** feature toggle.
