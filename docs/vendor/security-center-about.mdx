# About the Security Center (Beta)

This topic provides an overview of the Replicated Security Center.

## Overview

The Security Center is a comprehensive, web-based security management portal that provides a centralized location where your customers can:
* Monitor security vulnerabilities and compliance status
* Configure security policies and governance rules
* View security scan results and remediation guidance
* Manage security incidents and alerts
* Track security metrics and reporting
* And more

The following shows an example of the Security Center dashboard:

Your customers can access the Security Center outside their application installation environment at a custom domain that you specify, making it easier for security teams to monitor and manage application security posture.

The following diagram shows how customers can use the Security Center to monitor security status and implement governance policies:

As shown in the diagram above, your licensed customers can access comprehensive security monitoring and management capabilities by logging in to the Security Center. The Security Center tracks security events and compliance status, and shares those insights back to the Vendor Portal. Customers can also configure automated security responses and receive real-time security alerts through the Security Center.
