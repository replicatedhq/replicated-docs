# About the Security Center (Alpha)

This topic provides an overview of the Replicated Security Center.

## Overview

The Security Center allows Vendors and their Enterprise customers to monitor and manage security settings, vulnerabilities, and compliance for your applications.
* View vulnerable container images
* View CVE details
* And more

If the feature flag is enabled for your account, you can access Security Center in the left-side navigation in Vendor Portal. You can also allow your customers to access their own version of Security Center as a tab within their Enterprise Portal. This is enabled on a per-customer level under Customers -> Enterprise Portal access. 

The following shows an example of the vendor-facing Security Center dashboard within Vendor Portal:
