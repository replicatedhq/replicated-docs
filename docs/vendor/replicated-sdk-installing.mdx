# Installing the Replicated SDK (Beta)

This topic describes the methods for distributing and installing the Replicated SDK.

It includes information about how to install the SDK alongside Helm chart- or standard manifest-based applications using the Helm CLI or Replicated KOTS. It also includes information about installing the SDK separately from an application as a standalone component in integration mode.

For information about installing the SDK in air gap mode, see [Installing the SDK in Air Gap Environments](replicated-sdk-airgap).

## Requirement

<KotsVerReq/>

## Install the SDK as a Subchart

When included as a dependency of your application Helm chart, the SDK is installed as a subchart alongside the application.

To install the SDK as a subchart:

1. In your application Helm chart `Chart.yaml` file, add the YAML below to declare the SDK as a dependency. If your application is installed as multiple charts, declare the SDK as a dependency of the chart that customers install first. Do not declare the SDK in more than one chart.

     <DependencyYaml/>

1. <RegistryLogout/> 

1. Update the `charts/` directory:

    ```
    helm dependency update
    ```
    
1. Package the Helm chart into a `.tgz` archive:

   ```
   helm package .
   ```  

1. Add the chart archive to a new release. For more information, see [Managing Releases with the CLI](/vendor/releases-creating-cli) or [Managing Releases with the Vendor Portal](/vendor/releases-creating-releases).

1. (Optional) Add a HelmChart custom resource to the release to support installation with KOTS. For more information, see [About Distributing Helm Charts with KOTS](/vendor/helm-native-about) and [HelmChart v2](/reference/custom-resource-helmchart-v2).

1. Save and promote the release to an internal-only channel used for testing, such as the default Unstable channel.

1. Install the release using the Helm CLI or KOTS. For information about installing releases with the Helm CLI, see [Installing with Helm](/vendor/install-with-helm). For information about installing with KOTS, see [About Installing an Application](/enterprise/installing-overview).

1. Confirm that the SDK was installed by seeing that the `replicated` Deployment was created:

    ```
    kubectl get deploy --namespace NAMESPACE
    ```
    Where `NAMESPACE` is the namespace in the cluster where the application and the SDK are installed. 

    **Example output**:

    ```
    NAME         READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
    my-app       1/1     1            1           35s
    replicated   1/1     1            1           35s
    ```

## Install the SDK Alongside a Standard Manifest-Based Application

For applications that use standard Kubernetes manifest files, the SDK Helm chart can be added to a release and then installed by KOTS alongside the application.

<KotsVerReq/>

To add the SDK Helm chart to a release for a standard manifest-based application:

1. Install the Helm CLI using Homebrew:

    ```
    brew install helm
    ```
    For more information, including alternative installation options, see [Install Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) in the Helm documentation.

1. Download the `.tgz` chart archive for the SDK Helm chart:

    ```
    helm pull oci://registry.replicated.com/library/replicated --version SDK_VERSION
    ```
    Where `SDK_VERSION` is the version of the SDK to install. For a list of available SDK versions, see the [replicated-sdk repository](https://github.com/replicatedhq/replicated-sdk/tags) in GitHub.

    The output of this command is a `.tgz` file with the naming convention `CHART_NAME-CHART_VERSION.tgz`. For example, `replicated-1.0.0-beta.31.tgz`.

    For more information and additional options, see [Helm Pull](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_pull/) in the Helm documentation.

1. Add the SDK `.tgz` chart archive to a new release. For more information, see [Managing Releases with the CLI](/vendor/releases-creating-cli) or [Managing Releases with the Vendor Portal](/vendor/releases-creating-releases).

    The following shows an example of the SDK Helm chart added to a draft release for a standard manifest-based application:

    ![SDK Helm chart in a draft release](/images/sdk-kots-release.png)
    
    [View a larger version of this image](/images/sdk-kots-release.png)

1. If one was not created automatically, add a Replicated HelmChart custom resource to the release. HelmChart custom resources have `apiVersion: kots.io/v1beta2` and `kind: HelmChart`. 

     **Example:**
  
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: kots.io/v1beta2
    kind: HelmChart
    metadata:
      name: replicated
    spec:
    # chart identifies a matching chart from a .tgz
      chart:
        # for name, enter replicated
        name: replicated
        # for chartversion, enter the version of the
        # SDK Helm chart in the release
        chartVersion: 1.0.0-beta.31
    ```

     As shown in the example above, the HelmChart custom resource requires the name and version of the SDK Helm chart that you added to the release:
     * **`chart.name`**: The name of the SDK Helm chart is `replicated`. You can find the chart name in the `name` field of the SDK Helm chart `Chart.yaml` file.
     * **`chart.chartVersion`**: The chart version varies depending on the version of the SDK that you pulled and added to the release. You can find the chart version in the `version` field of SDK Helm chart `Chart.yaml` file.

     For more information about configuring the HelmChart custom resource to support KOTS installations, see [About Distributing Helm Charts with KOTS](/vendor/helm-native-about) and [HelmChart v2](/reference/custom-resource-helmchart-v2).

1. Save and promote the release to an internal-only channel used for testing, such as the default Unstable channel.

1. Install the release using KOTS. For more information, see [About Installing an Application](/enterprise/installing-overview).

1. Confirm that the SDK was installed by seeing that the `replicated` Deployment was created:

    ```
    kubectl get deploy --namespace NAMESPACE
    ```
    Where `NAMESPACE` is the namespace in the cluster where the application, the Admin Console, and the SDK are installed. 

    **Example output**:

    ```
    NAME         READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
    kotsadm      1/1     1            1           112s
    my-app       1/1     1            1           28s
    replicated   1/1     1            1           27s
    ```

## Install the SDK in Integration Mode

You can use the Replicated SDK in integration mode to develop locally against the SDK API without needing to add the SDK to your application, create a release in the Replicated Vendor Portal, or make changes in your environment. You can also use integration mode to test sending instance data to the Vendor Portal, including any custom metrics that you configure.

To use integration mode, install the Replicated SDK as a standalone component using a valid development license. For more information, see [Developing Against the SDK API](/vendor/replicated-sdk-development).
