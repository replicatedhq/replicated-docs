# Install the Replicated SDK

This topic describes the methods for distributing and installing the Replicated SDK.

It includes information about how to install the SDK alongside Helm charts or Kubernetes manifest-based applications using the Helm CLI or a Replicated installer (Replicated KOTS, kURL, Embedded Cluster). It also includes information about installing the SDK as a standalone component in integration mode.

For information about installing the SDK in air gap mode, see [Install the SDK in Air Gap Environments](replicated-sdk-airgap).

## Requirement

<KotsVerReq/>

## Install the SDK as a Subchart

When included as a dependency of your application Helm chart, the SDK is installed as a subchart alongside the application.

To install the SDK as a subchart:

1. In your application Helm chart `Chart.yaml` file, add the YAML below to declare the SDK as a dependency. If your application is installed as multiple charts, declare the SDK as a dependency of the chart that customers install first. Do not declare the SDK in more than one chart.

     <DependencyYaml/>

1. Update the `charts/` directory:

    ```
    helm dependency update
    ```
    :::note
    <RegistryLogout/>
    :::

1. Package the Helm chart into a `.tgz` archive:

   ```
   helm package .
   ```

1. Add the chart archive to a new release. For more information, see [Manage Releases with the CLI](/vendor/releases-creating-cli) or [Managing Releases with the Vendor Portal](/vendor/releases-creating-releases).

1. (Optional) Add a KOTS HelmChart custom resource to the release to support installation with Embedded Cluster, KOTS, or kURL. For more information, see [Configure the HelmChart Custom Resource v2](/vendor/helm-native-v2-using).

1. Save and promote the release to an internal-only channel used for testing, such as the default Unstable channel.

1. Install the release using Helm or a Replicated installer. For more information, see:
     * [Online Installation with Embedded Cluster](/enterprise/installing-embedded)
     * [Installing with Helm](/vendor/install-with-helm)
     * [Online Installation in Existing Clusters with KOTS](/enterprise/installing-existing-cluster)
     * [Online Installation with kURL](/enterprise/installing-kurl)

1. Confirm that the SDK was installed by seeing that the `replicated` Deployment was created:

    ```
    kubectl get deploy --namespace NAMESPACE
    ```
    Where `NAMESPACE` is the namespace in the cluster where the application and the SDK are installed.

    **Example output**:

    ```
    NAME         READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
    my-app       1/1     1            1           35s
    replicated   1/1     1            1           35s
    ```

## Install the SDK Alongside a Kubernetes Manifest-Based Application {#manifest-app}

For applications that use Kubernetes manifest files instead of Helm charts, the SDK Helm chart can be added to a release and then installed by KOTS alongside the application.

<KotsVerReq/>

To add the SDK Helm chart to a release for a Kubernetes manifest-based application:

1. Install the Helm CLI using Homebrew:

    ```
    brew install helm
    ```
    For more information, including alternative installation options, see [Install Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) in the Helm documentation.

1. Download the `.tgz` chart archive for the SDK Helm chart:

    ```
    helm pull oci://registry.replicated.com/library/replicated --version SDK_VERSION
    ```
    Where `SDK_VERSION` is the version of the SDK to install. For a list of available SDK versions, see the [replicated-sdk repository](https://github.com/replicatedhq/replicated-sdk/tags) in GitHub.

    The output of this command is a `.tgz` file with the naming convention `CHART_NAME-CHART_VERSION.tgz`. For example, `replicated-1.5.0.tgz`.

    For more information and additional options, see [Helm Pull](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_pull/) in the Helm documentation.

1. Add the SDK `.tgz` chart archive to a new release. For more information, see [Manage Releases with the CLI](/vendor/releases-creating-cli) or [Managing Releases with the Vendor Portal](/vendor/releases-creating-releases).

    The following shows an example of the SDK Helm chart added to a draft release for a standard manifest-based application:

    ![SDK Helm chart in a draft release](/images/sdk-kots-release.png)

    [View a larger version of this image](/images/sdk-kots-release.png)

1. If one was not created automatically, add a KOTS HelmChart custom resource to the release. HelmChart custom resources have `apiVersion: kots.io/v1beta2` and `kind: HelmChart`.

     **Example:**

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: kots.io/v1beta2
    kind: HelmChart
    metadata:
      name: replicated
    spec:
    # chart identifies a matching chart from a .tgz
      chart:
        # for name, enter replicated
        name: replicated
        # for chartversion, enter the version of the
        # SDK Helm chart in the release
        chartVersion: 1.7.0
    ```

     As shown in the example above, the HelmChart custom resource requires the name and version of the SDK Helm chart that you added to the release:
     * **`chart.name`**: The name of the SDK Helm chart is `replicated`. You can find the chart name in the `name` field of the SDK Helm chart `Chart.yaml` file.
     * **`chart.chartVersion`**: The chart version varies depending on the version of the SDK that you pulled and added to the release. You can find the chart version in the `version` field of SDK Helm chart `Chart.yaml` file.

     For more information about configuring the HelmChart custom resource to support KOTS installations, see [About Distributing Helm Charts with KOTS](/vendor/helm-native-about) and [HelmChart v2](/reference/custom-resource-helmchart-v2).

1. Save and promote the release to an internal-only channel used for testing, such as the default Unstable channel.

1. Install the release using a Replicated installer. For more information, see:
     * [Online Installation with Embedded Cluster](/enterprise/installing-embedded)
     * [Online Installation in Existing Clusters with KOTS](/enterprise/installing-existing-cluster)
     * [Online Installation with kURL](/enterprise/installing-kurl)

1. Confirm that the SDK was installed by seeing that the `replicated` Deployment was created:

    ```
    kubectl get deploy --namespace NAMESPACE
    ```
    Where `NAMESPACE` is the namespace in the cluster where the application, the Admin Console, and the SDK are installed.

    **Example output**:

    ```
    NAME         READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
    kotsadm      1/1     1            1           112s
    my-app       1/1     1            1           28s
    replicated   1/1     1            1           27s
    ```

## Troubleshoot

### 401 Unauthorized Error When Updating Helm Dependencies {#401}

#### Symptom

You see an error message similar to the following after adding the Replicated SDK as a dependency in your Helm chart then running `helm dependency update`:

```
Error: could not download oci://registry.replicated.com/library/replicated-sdk: failed to authorize: failed to fetch oauth token: unexpected status from GET request to https://registry.replicated.com/v2/token?scope=repository%3Alibrary%2Freplicated-sdk%3Apull&service=registry.replicated.com: 401 Unauthorized
```

#### Cause

When you run `helm dependency update`, Helm attempts to pull the Replicated SDK chart from the Replicated registry. An error can occur if you are already logged in to the Replicated registry with a license that has expired, such as when testing application releases.

#### Solution

To solve this issue:

1. Run the following command to remove login credentials for the Replicated registry:

    ```
    helm registry logout registry.replicated.com
    ```

1. Re-run `helm dependency update` for your Helm chart.
