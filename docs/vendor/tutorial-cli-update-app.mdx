# Step 9: Update the Application

To test the new release that you promoted, return to the Admin Console in a browser to update the application.

To update the application:

1. Access the KOTS Admin Console using `https://localhost:8800` if the installation script is still running. Otherwise, run the following command to access the Admin Console:

    ```bash
    kubectl kots admin-console --namespace NAMESPACE
    ```

    Replace `NAMESPACE` with the namespace where the Admin Console is installed.

1. Go to the Version history page, and click **Check for update**.

    The Admin Console loads the new release that you promoted.

1. Click **Deploy**. In the dialog, click **Yes, deploy** to deploy the new version.
