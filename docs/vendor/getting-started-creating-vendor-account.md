# Creating a Vendor Account

To get started with Replicated, you must create a Replicated vendor account. When you create your account, you are also prompted to create an application.

The vendor portal is the user interface where vendors define Kubernetes manifest files, including application manifests and custom resource manifests, for their application. These files describe to the app manager how to package the application for distribution. Vendors can also use the vendor portal to manage other artifacts, such as customer license files, image registries, and release channels.

To create a vendor account:

1. Go to the [vendor portal](https://vendor.replicated.com), where you can log in or create an account.
1. To create an account, select **Create a new team**. The Start a trial page opens.
1. Enter your name, email, and contact information.
1. Create a password, and click **Getting Started**. An activation code is sent to the email address you registered with, and the Activate account page opens.

    **Note:** To resend the code, click **Resend it**.
1. Copy and paste the activation code into the text box, and click **Activate**. The Create application page opens.

    **Note** To create additional applications in the future, log in to the vendor portal and select **Create new app** from the Applications drop-down list.

1. Enter the name of your application, and click **Create application**. The application is created and the Channels page opens. You account is ready to use for packaging and deploying your application.
