# About Embedded Kubernetes

This topic describes Replicated's embedded Kubernetes solutions, which allow software vendors to deliver Kubernetes alongside their application for the purpose of supporting installations on virtual machines (VMs) or bare metal servers.

## Overview

<EmbeddedKubernetes/>

Providing an embedded Kubernetes option for installation is also beneficial to enterprise users because it allows users to install the application without needing to also manage and interact directly with Kubernetes. This is especially important for users that lack experience with Kubernetes, or for users that can more easily provision virtual or physical harware in their environment compared to managing Kubernetes.
