# About Embedded Kubernetes

This topic describes Replicated's embedded Kubernetes solutions, which allow software vendors to deliver Kubernetes alongside their application for the purpose of supporting installations on virtual machines (VMs) or bare metal servers.

## Overview

_Embedded Kubernetes_ refers to delivering a Kubernetes distribution alongside an application, so that both Kubernetes and the application are deployed in the customer environment. Embedding Kubernetes allows software vendors to install their Kubernetes application in non-Kubernetes customer-controlled environments, such as virtual machines (VMs) or bare metal servers. Additionally, software vendors that embed Kubernetes with their application have greater control over the charactersitics of the cluster where their application is installed. This allows vendors to deliver a cluster that meets their application's requirements, which can help reduce errors during installation. 

Providing an embedded Kubernetes option for installation is also beneficial to enterprise users because it allows users to install the application without needing to also manage and interact directly with Kubernetes. This is especially important for users that lack experience with Kubernetes, or for users that can more easily provision virtual or physical harware in their environment compared to managing Kubernetes.
