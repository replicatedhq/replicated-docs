# Troubleshooting Embedded Cluster

This topic provides information about troubleshooting Replicated Embedded Cluster installations. For more information about Embedded Cluster, including built-in extensions and architecture, see [Embedded Cluster Overview](/vendor/embedded-overview).

## Troubleshoot with Support Bundles

This section includes information about how to collect support bundles for Embedded Cluster installations. For more information about support bundles, see [About Preflight Checks and Support Bundles](/vendor/preflight-support-bundle-about).

### About the Default Embedded Cluster Support Bundle Spec

<SupportBundleIntro/>

<EmbeddedClusterSupportBundle/>

## View Logs

You can view logs for both Embedded Cluster and the systemd k0s service running in the cluster to help troubleshoot Embedded Cluster deployments.

### View Installation Logs for Embedded Cluster

To view installation logs for Embedded Cluster:

1. SSH onto a controller node.

1. Navigate to `/var/log/embedded-cluster` and open the `.log` file to view logs. 

### View Embedded Cluster Operator Pod Logs

The Embedded Cluster Operator is used for reporting purposes as well as some clean up operations. The `embedded-cluster-operator` pod contains logs that can be useful for troubleshooting, including the reconciliation loop for Embedded Cluster installation.

To view Embedded Cluster Operator pod logs:

1. SSH onto a controller node.

1. Use the Embedded Cluster shell command to start a shell with access to the cluster:

     ```
     sudo ./APP_SLUG shell
     ```
     Where `APP_SLUG` is the unique slug for the application.

1. Get the name of the Embedded Cluster Operator pod from the `embedded-cluster` namespace:

     ```bash
     kubectl get pod -n embedded-cluster
     ```
     The output contains the name of the Operator pod.

1. Use the `kubectl logs` command to view logs for the Operator pod. For more information about this command, including supported options to filter logs, see [kubectl logs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/generated/kubectl_logs) in the Kubernetes documentation.

    **Example:**

     ```bash
     kubectl logs embedded-operator-123456abcd -n embedded-clsuter --limit-bytes=1000
     ```

### View k0s Logs

You can use the journalctl command line tool to access logs for systemd services, including k0s.

To use journalctl to view k0s logs:

1. SSH onto a controller node.

1. Use journalctl to view logs for the k0s systemd service that was deployed by Embedded Cluster.

    **Example:**

    ```bash
    journalctl -u k0scontroller
    ```

## Access the Cluster

When troubleshooting, it can be useful to list the cluster and view logs using the kubectl command line tool. For additional suggestions related to troubleshooting applications, see [Troubleshooting Applications](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/debug-application/) in the Kubernetes documentation.

## Troubleshoot Errors

This section provides troubleshooting advice for common errors.

### Installation failure when NVIDIA GPU Operator is included as Helm extension

#### Symptom

A release that includes that includes the NVIDIA GPU Operator as a Helm extensions fails to install.

#### Cause 

If there are any containerd services on the host, the NVIDIA GPU Operator will generate an invalid containerd config, causing the installation to fail.

#### Solution

Remove any existing containerd services that are running on the host (such as those deployed by Docker) before attempting to install the release with Embedded Cluster.

For more information, see [NVIDIA GPU Operator](/vendor/embedded-using#nvidia-gpu-operator) in _Using Embedded Cluster_.

### Calico networking issues 

#### Symptom

Symptoms of Calico networking issues can include:

* The pod is stuck in a CrashLoopBackOff state with failed health checks:

    ```
    Warning Unhealthy 6h51m (x3 over 6h52m) kubelet Liveness probe failed: Get "http://<ip:port>/readyz": dial tcp <ip:port>: connect: no route to host
    Warning Unhealthy 6h51m (x19 over 6h52m) kubelet Readiness probe failed: Get "http://<ip:port>/readyz": dial tcp <ip:port>: connect: no route to host
    ....
    Unhealthy               pod/registry-dc699cbcf-pkkbr     Readiness probe failed: Get "https://<ip:port>/": net/http: request canceled while waiting for connection (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)
    Unhealthy               pod/registry-dc699cbcf-pkkbr     Liveness probe failed: Get "https://<ip:port>/": net/http: request canceled while waiting for connection (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)
    ...
    ```

* The pod log contains an I/O timeout:

    ```
    server APIs: config.k8ssandra.io/v1beta1: Get \"https://***HIDDEN***:443/apis/config.k8ssandra.io/v1beta1\": dial tcp ***HIDDEN***:443: i/o timeout"}
    ```

#### Cause 

Reasons can include:

* Pod CIDR and service CIDR overlap with the host network CIDR.

* Incorrect kernel parameters values.

* VXLAN traffic getting dropped. By default, Calico uses VXLAN as the overlay networking protocol, with Always mode. This mode encapsulates all pod-to-pod traffic in VXLAN packets. If for some reasons, the VXLAN packets get filtered by the network, the pod will not able to communicate with other pods.

#### Solution

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="overlap" label="Pod CIDR and service CIDR overlap with the host network CIDR" default>
  To troubleshoot pod CIDR and service CIDR overlapping with the host network CIDR:
  1. Run the following command to verify the pod and service CIDR:
        ```
        cat /etc/k0s/k0s.yaml | grep -i cidr
            podCIDR: 10.244.0.0/17
            serviceCIDR: 10.244.128.0/17
        ```
        The default pod CIDR is 10.244.0.0/16 and service CIDR is 10.96.0.0/12.

    1. View pod network interfaces excluding Calico interfaces, and ensure there are no overlapping CIDRs.
        ```
        ip route | grep -v cali
        default via 10.152.0.1 dev ens4 proto dhcp src 10.152.0.4 metric 100
        10.152.0.1 dev ens4 proto dhcp scope link src 10.152.0.4 metric 100
        blackhole 10.244.101.192/26 proto 80
        169.254.169.254 via 10.152.0.1 dev ens4 proto dhcp src 10.152.0.4 metric 100
        ```

    1. Reset and reboot the installation:

       ```bash
       sudo ./APP_SLUG reset
       ```
       Where `APP_SLUG` is the unique slug for the application. 

       For more information, see [Reset a Node](/vendor/embedded-using#reset-a-node) in _Using Embedded Cluster_.

    1. Reinstall the application with different CIDRs using the `--cidr` flag:

        ```bash
        sudo ./APP_SLUG install --license license.yaml --cidr 172.16.136.0/16
        ```

        For more information, see [Embedded Cluster Install Options](/reference/embedded-cluster-install).
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="kernel" label="Incorrect kernel parameter values">
  To troubleshoot incorrect kernel parameter values:
  1. Use sysctl to verify that these parameters are set correctly:

        ```bash
        net.ipv4.conf.default.arp_filter = 0
        net.ipv4.conf.default.arp_ignore = 0
        net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
        ```            
    
    1. If the values are not set correctly, run the following command to set them:

        ```
        sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.default.arp_filter=0
        sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.default.arp_ignore=0
        sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1


        echo "net.ipv4.conf.default.arp_filter=0" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
        echo "net.ipv4.conf.default.arp_ignore=0" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
        echo "net.ipv4.ip_forward=1" >> /etc/sysctl.conf

        sysctl -p
        ```

    1. Reset and reboot the installation:

       ```bash
       sudo ./APP_SLUG reset
       ```
       Where `APP_SLUG` is the unique slug for the application. 
       For more information, see [Reset a Node](/vendor/embedded-using#reset-a-node) in _Using Embedded Cluster_.

    1. Re-run the installation.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="vxlan" label="VXLAN traffic dropped">

  As a temporary troubleshooting measure, set the mode to CrossSubnet and see if the issue persists. This mode only encapsulates traffic between pods across different subnets with VXLAN.

        ```bash
        kubectl patch ippool default-ipv4-ippool --type=merge -p '{"spec": {"vxlanMode": "CrossSubnet"}}'
        ```
    
    If this resolves the connectivity issues, there is likely an underlying network configuration problem with VXLAN traffic that should be addressed.
