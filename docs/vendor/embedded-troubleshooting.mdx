# Troubleshooting Embedded Cluster

This topic provides information about troubleshooting Replicated Embedded Cluster installations. For more information about Embedded Cluster, including built-in extensions and architecture, see [Embedded Cluster Overview](/vendor/embedded-overview).

## Troubleshoot with Support Bundles

This section includes information about how to collect support bundles for Embedded Cluster installations. For more information about support bundles, see [About Preflight Checks and Support Bundles](/vendor/preflight-support-bundle-about).

### About the Default Embedded Cluster Support Bundle Spec

<SupportBundleIntro/>

<EmbeddedClusterSupportBundle/>

## View Logs

You can view logs for both Embedded Cluster and the k0s systemd service to help troubleshoot Embedded Cluster deployments.

### View Installation Logs for Embedded Cluster

To view installation logs for Embedded Cluster:

1. SSH onto a controller node.

1. Navigate to `/var/log/embedded-cluster` and open the `.log` file to view logs.

### View k0s Logs

You can use the journalctl command line tool to access logs for systemd services, including k0s. For more information about k0s, see the [k0s documentation](https://docs.k0sproject.io/stable/).

To use journalctl to view k0s logs:

1. SSH onto a controller node or a worker node.

1. Use journalctl to view logs for the k0s systemd service that was deployed by Embedded Cluster.

    **Examples:**

    ```bash
    journalctl -u k0scontroller
    ```
    ```bash
    journalctl -u k0sworker
    ```

## Access the Cluster

When troubleshooting, it can be useful to list the cluster and view logs using the kubectl command line tool. For additional suggestions related to troubleshooting applications, see [Troubleshooting Applications](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/debug-application/) in the Kubernetes documentation.

## Troubleshoot Errors

This section provides troubleshooting advice for common errors.

### Installation failure when NVIDIA GPU Operator is included as Helm extension {#nvidia}

#### Symptom

A release that includes that includes the NVIDIA GPU Operator as a Helm extension fails to install.

#### Cause 

If there are any containerd services on the host, the NVIDIA GPU Operator will generate an invalid containerd config, causing the installation to fail.

This is the result of a known issue with v24.9.x of the NVIDIA GPU Operator. For more information about the known issue, see [container-toolkit does not modify the containerd config correctly when there are multiple instances of the containerd binary](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-container-toolkit/issues/982) in the nvidia-container-toolkit repository in GitHub.

For more information about including the GPU Operator as a Helm extension, see [NVIDIA GPU Operator](/vendor/embedded-using#nvidia-gpu-operator) in _Using Embedded Cluster_.

#### Solution

To troubleshoot:

1. Remove any existing containerd services that are running on the host (such as those deployed by Docker).

1. Reset and reboot the node:

    ```bash
    sudo ./APP_SLUG reset
    ```
    Where `APP_SLUG` is the unique slug for the application. 

    For more information, see [Reset a Node](/vendor/embedded-using#reset-a-node) in _Using Embedded Cluster_.

1. Re-install with Embedded Cluster.

### Calico networking issues 

#### Symptom

Symptoms of Calico networking issues can include:

* The pod is stuck in a CrashLoopBackOff state with failed health checks:

    ```
    Warning Unhealthy 6h51m (x3 over 6h52m) kubelet Liveness probe failed: Get "http://<ip:port>/readyz": dial tcp <ip:port>: connect: no route to host
    Warning Unhealthy 6h51m (x19 over 6h52m) kubelet Readiness probe failed: Get "http://<ip:port>/readyz": dial tcp <ip:port>: connect: no route to host
    ....
    Unhealthy               pod/registry-dc699cbcf-pkkbr     Readiness probe failed: Get "https://<ip:port>/": net/http: request canceled while waiting for connection (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)
    Unhealthy               pod/registry-dc699cbcf-pkkbr     Liveness probe failed: Get "https://<ip:port>/": net/http: request canceled while waiting for connection (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)
    ...
    ```

* The pod log contains an I/O timeout:

    ```
    server APIs: config.k8ssandra.io/v1beta1: Get \"https://***HIDDEN***:443/apis/config.k8ssandra.io/v1beta1\": dial tcp ***HIDDEN***:443: i/o timeout"}
    ```

#### Cause 

Reasons can include:

* Pod CIDR and service CIDR overlap with the host network CIDR.

* Incorrect kernel parameters values.

* VXLAN traffic getting dropped. By default, Calico uses VXLAN as the overlay networking protocol, with Always mode. This mode encapsulates all pod-to-pod traffic in VXLAN packets. If for some reasons, the VXLAN packets get filtered by the network, the pod will not able to communicate with other pods.

#### Solution

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="overlap" label="Pod CIDR and service CIDR overlap with the host network CIDR" default>
  To troubleshoot pod CIDR and service CIDR overlapping with the host network CIDR:
  1. Run the following command to verify the pod and service CIDR:
        ```
        cat /etc/k0s/k0s.yaml | grep -i cidr
            podCIDR: 10.244.0.0/17
            serviceCIDR: 10.244.128.0/17
        ```
        The default pod CIDR is 10.244.0.0/16 and service CIDR is 10.96.0.0/12.

    1. View pod network interfaces excluding Calico interfaces, and ensure there are no overlapping CIDRs.
        ```
        ip route | grep -v cali
        default via 10.152.0.1 dev ens4 proto dhcp src 10.152.0.4 metric 100
        10.152.0.1 dev ens4 proto dhcp scope link src 10.152.0.4 metric 100
        blackhole 10.244.101.192/26 proto 80
        169.254.169.254 via 10.152.0.1 dev ens4 proto dhcp src 10.152.0.4 metric 100
        ```

    1. Reset and reboot the installation:

       ```bash
       sudo ./APP_SLUG reset
       ```
       Where `APP_SLUG` is the unique slug for the application. 

       For more information, see [Reset a Node](/vendor/embedded-using#reset-a-node) in _Using Embedded Cluster_.

    1. Reinstall the application with different CIDRs using the `--cidr` flag:

        ```bash
        sudo ./APP_SLUG install --license license.yaml --cidr 172.16.136.0/16
        ```

        For more information, see [Embedded Cluster Install Options](/reference/embedded-cluster-install).
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="kernel" label="Incorrect kernel parameter values">
  Embedded Cluster 1.19.0 and later automatically sets the `net.ipv4.conf.default.arp_filter`, `net.ipv4.conf.default.arp_ignore`, and `net.ipv4.ip_forward` kernel parameters. Additionally, host preflight checks automatically run during installation to verify that the kernel parameters were set correctly. For more information about the Embedded Cluster preflight checks, see [About Host Preflight Checks](/vendor/embedded-using#about-host-preflight-checks) in _Using Embedded Cluster_.

  If kernel parameters are not set correctly and these preflight checks fail, you might see a message such as `IP forwarding must be enabled.` or `ARP filtering must be disabled by default for newly created interfaces.`.

  To troubleshoot incorrect kernel parameter values:       
    
    1. Use sysctl to set the kernel parameters to the correct values:

        ```bash
        sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.default.arp_filter=0
        sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.default.arp_ignore=0
        sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1


        echo "net.ipv4.conf.default.arp_filter=0" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
        echo "net.ipv4.conf.default.arp_ignore=0" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
        echo "net.ipv4.ip_forward=1" >> /etc/sysctl.conf

        sysctl -p
        ```

    1. Reset and reboot the installation:

       ```bash
       sudo ./APP_SLUG reset
       ```
       Where `APP_SLUG` is the unique slug for the application. 
       For more information, see [Reset a Node](/vendor/embedded-using#reset-a-node) in _Using Embedded Cluster_.

    1. Re-install with Embedded Cluster.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="vxlan" label="VXLAN traffic dropped">

  As a temporary troubleshooting measure, set the mode to CrossSubnet and see if the issue persists. This mode only encapsulates traffic between pods across different subnets with VXLAN.

        ```bash
        kubectl patch ippool default-ipv4-ippool --type=merge -p '{"spec": {"vxlanMode": "CrossSubnet"}}'
        ```
    
    If this resolves the connectivity issues, there is likely an underlying network configuration problem with VXLAN traffic that should be addressed.
