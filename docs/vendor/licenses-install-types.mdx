# Managing Install Types for a License (Beta)

This topic describes how to manage which installation types and options are enabled for a license.

:::note
The "Install Types" licensing feature described in this topic is in Beta. To get access to this feature, reach out to your Replicated account rep.

## Overview

You can control which installation methods are available to each of your customers by enabling or disabling **Install types** fields in the customer's license. 

The following shows an example of the **Install types** field in a license:

The installation types that are enabled or disabled for a license determine the following:
* The Replicated installers (Replicated KOTS, Replicated Embedded Cluster, Replicated kURL) that the customer's license entitles them to use 
* The installation assets and/or instructions provided in the Replicated Download Portal for the customer
* The customer's KOTS Admin Console experience

Setting the supported installation types on a per-customer basis gives you greater control over the installation method used by each customer. It also allows you to provide a more curated Download Portal experience, in that customers will only see the installation assets and instructions that are relevant to them.

### About Available Install Types

The **Available install types** license field provides the following options:
* **Existing Cluster (Helm CLI):** Show instructions in the Download Portal for installing with Helm CLI. Requires that the latest release promoted to the channel where the customer is assigned contains a Helm chart.
* **Existing Cluster (KOTS install):** Allow the customer to install with Replicated KOTS in an existing cluster. This field has the following requirements:
     * Your Vendor Portal team must have the KOTS entitlement
     * The latest release promoted to the channel where the customer is assigned must contain KOTS custom resources
* **kURL Embedded Cluster (first generation product):** Allow the customer to install with Replicated kURL. This field has the following requirements:
     * Your Vendor Portal team must have the KOTS/kURL entitlement
     * A kURL installer spec must be promoted to the channel where the customer is assigned
* **Embedded Cluster (current generation product):** Allow the customer to install with Replicated Embedded Cluster. This field has the following requirements:
     * Your Vendor Portal team must have the Embedded Cluster entitlement
     * The latest release promoted to the channel where the customer is assigned must contain an Embedded Cluster Config custom resource 

### About Additional Install Options

After enabling installation types in the **Available install types** field, you can also enable the following options in the **Additional install options** field:

* **Helm CLI Air Gap Instructions (Helm CLI only):** When enabled, a customer will see instructions on the Download Portal on how to pull Helm installable images into their local repository. **Helm CLI Air Gap Instructions** is enabled by default when you select the **Existing Cluster (Helm CLI)** install type.

* **Air Gap Installation Option (Replicated Installers only):** When enabled, new installations with this license will have an option to install from an air gap package or from a traditional online installation. Selecting this controls whether a customer sees this option in their Download Portal.

### How Install Types Determine the Download Portal Experience

Helm CLI Install + Helm Airgap = show the helm airgap install instructions
Existing Cluster (KOTS install) + Airgap = show existing cluster airgap instructions
kURL + Air Gap = show kURL air gap instructions 
Embedded Cluster + Airgap=False = Show online install instructions only
Embedded Cluster + Airgap=True = Show instructions on air gap environment installation

## About Migrating Existing Licenses to Include Install Types

By default, when an existing license is migrated to include the **Install types** field, the Vendor Portal automatically enables installation types so that the customer does not experience any errors in their deployment...
