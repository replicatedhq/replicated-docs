# About Customers

This topic provides an overview of customer licenses, including information about license types, the **Customers** page in the Replicated Vendor Portal, and how Replicated uses the customer entitlement information that you provide in licenses.

## Overview

Each customer that you create in the Replicated Vendor Portal has a unique license ID. Your customers use their license when they install or update your application.

You assign customers to channels in the Vendor Portal to control their access to your application releases. Customers can install or upgrade to releases that are promoted to the channel they are assigned. For example, assigning a customer to your Beta channel allows that customer to install or upgrade to only releases promoted to the Beta channel.

Each customer license includes several fields that uniquely identify the customer and the application, specify the customer's assigned release channel, and define the customer's entitlements, such as if the license has an expiration date or what application functionality the customer can access. Replicated securely delivers these entitlements to the application and makes them available at installation or at runtime.

For more information about how to create and manage customers, see [Creating and Managing Customers](releases-creating-customer).

## About License Types and Fields

This section describes license properties, including license types, built-in fields, and custom fields.

### License Types

Each customer license is assigned one of the following types:

* **Development**: The Development type can be used internally by the development
team for testing and integration.
* **Trial**: The Trial type can be used for customers who are on 2-4 week trials
of your software.
* **Paid**: The Paid type identifies the customer as a paying customer for which
additional information can be provided.
* **Community**: The Community type is designed for a free or low cost version of your application. For more details about this type, see [Community Licenses](licenses-about-types).

Except Community licenses, the license type is used solely for reporting purposes and a customer's access to your application is not affected by the type that you assign.

You can change the type of a license at any time in the Vendor Portal. For example, if a customer upgraded from a trial to a paid account, then you could change their license type from Trial to Paid for reporting purposes. 

### Built-in and Custom License Fields

Customer licenses have built-in fields and also support custom fields.

Built-in fields are reserved field names. You can specify the values for these fields to define entitlements for the customer. For example, Replicated includes built-in license fields to define the license expiration date, customer name, and application slug. For more information about built-in fields, see [Built-in License Fields](licenses-using-builtin-fields).

You can also create custom license fields to define entitlements specific to the customer. For example, you can create a custom license field to limit the number of active users permitted. For more information about creating custom license fields, see [Managing Custom License Fields](licenses-adding-custom-fields).

## About Updating Licenses

This section includes information about making changes to customer licenses, including editing license details in the Vendor Portal as well as how customers can update or replace licenses.

### Editing License Details and Entitlements

You can make changes to a customer in the Vendor Portal to edit their license details, such as the license type or customer name, at any time. You can also add, remove, and edit license options and custom fields. The license ID, which is the unique identifier for the customer, never changes.

For more information about how to edit licenses, see [Edit a Customer](releases-creating-customer#edit-a-customer) in _Creating and Managing Customers_.

### License Updates with KOTS

When you edit customer licenses for an application installed with KOTS, your customers can use the KOTS Admin Console to get the latest license details from the Vendor Portal, then deploy a new version that includes the license changes. Deploying a new version with the license changes ensures that any license fields that you have templated in your release using [KOTS template functions](/reference/template-functions-about) are rendered with the latest license details.

For online instances, KOTS pulls license details from the Vendor Portal when:
* A customer clicks **Sync license** in the Admin Console.
* An automatic or manual update check is performed by KOTS.
* An update is performed with Replicated Embedded Cluster. See [Performing Updates with Embedded Cluster](/enterprise/updating-embedded).
* An application status changes. See [Current State](instance-insights-details#current-state) in _Instance Details_.

For more information, see [Updating Licenses](/enterprise/updating-licenses).

### Air Gap License Updates with KOTS

To update licenses in air gap installations, customers need to upload the updated license file to the Admin Console.

After you update the license fields in the Vendor Portal, you can notify customers by either sending them a new license file or instructing them to log into their Download Portal to downlaod the new license.

For more information, see [Updating Licenses](/enterprise/updating-licenses).

### Retrieving License Details with the SDK API

The [Replicated SDK](replicated-sdk-overview) includes an in-cluster API that can be used to retrieve up-to-date customer license information from the Vendor Portal during runtime through the [`license`](/reference/replicated-sdk-apis#license) endpoints. This means that you can add logic to your application to get the latest license information without the customer needing to perform a license update. The SDK API polls the Vendor Portal for updated data every four hours.

In KOTS installations that include the SDK, users need to update their licenses from the Admin Console as described in [License Updates with KOTS](#license-updates-with-kots) above. However, any logic in your application that uses the SDK API will update the user's license information without the customer needing to deploy a license update in the Admin Console.

For information about how to use the SDK API to query license entitlements at runtime, see [Querying Entitlements with the Replicated SDK API](/vendor/licenses-reference-sdk).

### Replacing Licenses

Community licenses are the only license type that can be replaced with a new license without needing to reinstall the application. For more information, see [Community Licenses](licenses-about-types).

Unless the existing customer is using a community license, it is not possible to replace one license with another license without reinstalling the application. When you need to make changes to a customer's entitlements, Replicated recommends that you edit the customer's license details in the Vendor Portal, rather than issuing a new license.

## About License Expiration Handling {#expiration}

The built-in `expires_at` license field defines the expiration date for a customer license. When you set an expiration date in the Vendor Portal, the `expires_at` field is set to midnight UTC on the date selected.

Replicated enforces the following logic when a license expires:
* By default, instances with expired licenses continue to run.
   To change the behavior of your application when a license expires, you can can add custom logic in your application that queries the `expires_at` field using the Replicated SDK in-cluster API. For more information, see [Querying Entitlements with the Replicated SDK API](/vendor/licenses-reference-sdk).
* Expired licenses cannot log in to the Replicated registry to pull a Helm chart for installation or upgrade.
* Expired licenses cannot pull application images through the Replicated proxy registry or from the Replicated registry.
* In Replicated KOTS installations, KOTS prevents instances with expired licenses from receiving updates.

## About Customer Channel Assignment {#channel-assignment}

This section provides information about managing the channel a customer is assigned, including changing the assigned channel and manaing channel assignments for customers with or without the KOTS entitlement. For information about how to assign a customer to a channel, see [Create a Customer](releases-creating-customer#create-a-customer) in _Creating and Managing Customers_.

### Changing Channel Assignment

<ChangeChannel/>

For example, if the latest release promoted to the Beta channel is version 1.25.0 and version 1.10.0 is marked as required, when you edit an existing customer to assign them to the Beta channel, then the KOTS Admin Console always fetches 1.25.0, even though 1.10.0 is marked as required. The required release 1.10.0 is ignored and is not available to the customer for upgrade.

For more information about how to mark a release as required, see [Properties](releases-about#properties) in _About Channels and Releases_. For more information about how to synchronize licenses in the Admin Console, see [Updating Licenses](/enterprise/updating-licenses).
