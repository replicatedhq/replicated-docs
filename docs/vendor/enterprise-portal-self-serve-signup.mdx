# Self-Service Enterprise Portal Sign-Ups (Beta)

This topic describes how to enable Enterprise Portal self-service sign-ups. This allows users to access your application by signing up for Trial or Community licenses through the Enterprise Portal.

For information about customizing the Trial Signup invitation email, see [Customize the Enterprise Portal](enterprise-portal-configure).

## Overview

You can enable self-service sign-ups through the Enterprise Portal for your application. When self-service sign-ups are enabled, current and potential customers can access your application by signing up for a trial or community license. All licenses issued through self-service sign-ups are automatically configured based on the default license policy that you configure in the Vendor Portal.

## Enable Self-Service Sign-Ups {#enable-self-service-signup}

To enable Enterprise Portal self-service sign-ups:

1. In the Vendor Portal, go to **Enterprise Portal > Self Serve Signup**.

1. (Optional) For **Terms and Conditions URL**, enter a URL to the terms and conditions that the user must acknowlwedge before proceeding with signup.

1. For **License Configuration**, configure the default settings for licenses created through self-service signups, including the default channel, expiration date, license type (trial or community), supported installation types, and other support features.

1. Click **Save**.

## Share Your Sign-up URL {#share-trial-url}

Each application has a dedicated sign-up URL where users can access the self-servive sign up. When a new user naviagtes to the sign-up page and clicks **Create account**, they receive an email with a 12-digit verification code. The following shows an example of a self-service sign-up page for an application:

To view pending trials:

1. In the Vendor Portal, go to **Enterprise Portal > Self Serve Signup**.
1. Under **Pending Trials**, review details about any pending self-service sign-ups, including the user's email address, company, sign-up date and time, and more.
