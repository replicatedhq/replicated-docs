# Self-Service Enterprise Portal Sign-Ups (Beta)

This topic describes how to enable or disable self-service sign-ups to the Enterprise Portal to enable access to your application for the purposes of Trial or Community based licensing.

For information about customizing the Trial Signup invitation email, see [Customize the Enterprise Portal](enterprise-portal-configure).

## Enable Self-Service Sign-Ups {#enable-self-service-signup}

You can enable and disable customer self-service login access to the Enterprise Portal for current and potential customers through your Enterprise Portal. You are able to set a default policy that will then apply to any new customer licenses created via self-service sign-up.

To enable self-service customer access to the Enterprise Portal:

* In the Vendor Portal, go to **Enterprise Portal > Self Serve Signup**. 
* [Optional] Add a link to Terms & Conditions that the user must acknowlwedge before proceeding with signup.
* Configure the default settings for licenses created through self-service signups.
* Configure the default allowed installation types for licenses created through self-service signups.
* Click **Save**

## Share Your Sign-up URL {#share-trial-url}

Your dedicated sign-up URL is displayed underneath **Enable self-service sign-ups**.

Customers who access the sign-up URL will have the opportunity to self-service access to your application based on the default policy you have configured.

Once a new trial or community user clicks **Create account**, they will receive an email with a 12-digit verification code. 

If they have not yet confirmed via the confirmation email, they are considered a pending user. See [View Pending Trial Access to Your Application](#pending-user).

Once they have confirmed their account, they will no longer be considered pending status, and will now be available along with other active customers under **Customers**.

## View Pending Trial Access to Your Application {#pending-user}
