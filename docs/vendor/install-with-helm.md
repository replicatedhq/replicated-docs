# Installing with Helm

This topic describes how to use Helm to install releases that contain one or more Helm charts. For more information about the `helm install` command, including how to override values in a chart during installation, see [Helm Install](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_install/) in the Helm documentation.

## Prerequisites

Before you install, complete the following prerequisites:

* You must have a customer in the Replicated vendor portal with a valid email address. This email address is only used as a username for the Replicated registry and is never contacted. For more information about creating and editing customers in the vendor portal, see [Creating a Customer](/vendor/releases-creating-customer).
* (Recommended) To install the Replicated SDK alongside the application, declare the SDK as a dependency. For more information, see [How to Distribute the SDK](replicated-sdk-overview#how-to-distribute-the-sdk) in _About the Replicated SDK (Beta)_.

## Install

To install a Helm chart:

1. In the vendor portal, go to **Customers** and click on the target customer.

1. Click **Helm install instructions**.

1. In the **Helm install instructions** dialog, run the first command to log into the Replicated registry:

   ```bash
   helm registry login registry.replicated.com --username EMAIL_ADDRESS --password LICENSE_ID
   ```
   Replace `EMAIL_ADDRESS` and `LICENSE_ID` with the values provided in the command in the **Helm install instructions** dialog.

1. (Optional) Run the second and third commands to install the preflight plugin and run preflight checks. If no preflight checks are defined, these commands are not displayed. For more information about defining and running preflight checks, see [About Preflight Checks and Support Bundles](preflight-support-bundle-about).

1. Run the fourth command to install using Helm:

    ```bash
    helm install RELEASE_NAME oci://registry.replicated.com/APP_SLUG/CHANNEL_SLUG/CHART_NAME
    ```
    Replace `RELEASE_NAME`, `APP_SLUG`, `CHANNEL_SLUG`, and `CHART_NAME`, with the values provided in the command in the **Helm install instructions** dialog.

    :::note
    The channel slug is not required for releases promoted to the Stable channel.

    :::note
    To install the SDK with custom RBAC permissions, include the `--set` flag with the `helm install` command to override the value of the `replicated.serviceAccountName` field with a custom service account. For more information, see [Customizing RBAC for the SDK](/vendor/replicated-sdk-rbac).
    :::

1. (Optional) In the vendor portal, click **Customers**. You can see that the customer you used to install is marked as **Active** and the details about the application instance are listed under the customer name. 

   **Example**:
