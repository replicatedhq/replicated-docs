# Customize Support Bundles for Helm Installations

This topic provides a basic understanding and some key considerations about support bundle specifications for Helm installations to help guide you in defining them for your application.

## About Support Bundles

Customizing a support bundle is unique to your application and depends on what kind of data you need to troubleshoot. Replicated recommends designing comprehensive support bundle specifications to give you the most insight to problems in your customer environments and the help reduce your support burden. 

<PreflightsSbNote/>

<PreflightsSpecLocations/>

## Input Kind

You can create support bundle specification using the following kinds:

- Secret (`kind: Secret`)
- Support Bundle custom resource (`kind: SupportBundle`)

## Limitations

YAML file and URL locations do not support Helm templating.

## Define Support Bundles as Secrets

Replicated recommends using Secrets to contain a support bundle specifications in your Helm chart. This method allows customers to automatically discover and generate a support bundle without specifying a long URL. Using Secrets also allows specifications to be templated using information in the `values.yaml` file.

<ConfigmapNote/>

To customize a support bundle as a Secret, create a specification using `kind: Secret`. You must include the following fields:

- `Label` - Label the secret definition as `troubleshoot.sh/kind: support-bundle`
- `stringData` - Specify a `stringData` field with a key named `support-bundle-spec`

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  labels:
    troubleshoot.sh/kind: support-bundle
  name: {{ .Release.Name }}-support-bundle
  namespace: {{ .Release.Namespace }}
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # This is the support bundle spec that will be used to generate the support bundle
  # Notes: we use {{ .Release.Namespace }} to ensure that the support bundle is scoped to the release namespace
  # We can use any of Helm's templating features here, including {{ .Values.someValue }}
  support-bundle-spec: |
    apiVersion: troubleshoot.sh/v1beta2
    kind: SupportBundle
    metadata:
      name: support-bundle
    spec:
      collectors: []
      analyzers: []
```

## Define the Support Bundle Specification

### Cluster Collectors

You can add the `clusterInfo` and `clusterResources` collectors if you want to collect a large amount of data to help with installation and debugging. For `clusterResources`, you can add the default namespace or additional namespaces using the `namespaces` field.

The following example shows `clusterInfo` and `clusterResources` collectors with an additional namespace specified for the application.

```yaml
spec:
  collectors:
    - clusterInfo: []
    - clusterResources:
      namespaces:
      - default
      - my-app-namespace
```
### Pod Log Collectors

<SupportBundleAddLogs/>

The following example shows a Pod log collector:

```yaml
spec:
      collectors:
        - clusterInfo: []
        - clusterResources: []
        - logs:
            selector:
              - app=someapp
              - component=nginx
            namespace: {{ .Release.Namespace }}
            limits:
              maxAge: 720h # 30*24
              maxLines: 10000
              maxBytes: 5000000
```

### Other Recommended Collectors

<SupportBundleCustomCollectors/>

### Analyzers

<SupportBundleAddAnalyzers/>

The following example shows a deployment status collector with messages that can inform the customer as to the cause of an issue. You can customize the message to help guide customers to fix the issue on their own.

```yaml
spec:
      collectors: []
      analyzers: 
        - deploymentStatus:
            name: api
            namespace: default
            outcomes:
              - fail:
                  when: "< 1"
                  message: The API deployment does not have any ready replicas.
              - warn:
                  when: "= 1"
                  message: The API deployment has only a single ready replica.
              - pass:
                  message: There are multiple replicas of the API deployment ready.
```

## Example

The following example shows a support bundle specification as a Secret. For more examples, see the [Troubleshoot example repository](https://github.com/replicatedhq/troubleshoot/tree/main/examples/support-bundle) in GitHub.

```yaml

  # Notes: we use {{ .Release.Namespace }} to ensure that the support bundle is scoped to the release namespace
  # We can use any of Helm's templating features here, including {{ .Values.someValue }}

```

## Next Steps

- When using Secrets, you can also add Helm templates for the specification in the `values.yaml` file.

- Test your support bundle in a development environment. For more information, see [Generating Support Bundles](support-bundle-generating).
