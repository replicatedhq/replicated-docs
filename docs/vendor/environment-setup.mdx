# Set Up Your Environment

This topic describes how to set up your environment to get started with the Replicated Platform. It includes information about installing the required tools on your local workstation as well as creating development environments for testing installation and upgrade scenarios for your application.

## Set Up Your Local Workstation {#local}

This section lists the tools that you need to install on your local workstation to manage applications, releases, customers, and so on with the Replicated Platform.

### Install kubectl

kubectl is the Kubernetes command line tool. With the Replicated Platform, you can use kubectl to communicate with the clusters that you create with the Replicated Compatibility Matrix. kubectl is also useful when testing and troubleshooting installations in existing clusters. For more information about kubectl, see [Command line tool (kubectl)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/) in the Kubernetes documentation.

#### Mac

To install kubectl on Mac, do one of the following:

* (Recommended) Install with Homebrew:
    ```bash
    brew install kubectl
    ```
* Install with curl:

    To install kubectl on Mac using curl:
    ```bash
    curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/darwin/amd64/kubectl"
    chmod +x ./kubectl
    sudo mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
    ```

#### Linux

To install kubectl on Linux, do one of the following:

* Install with curl:

    ```bash
    curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
    chmod +x ./kubectl
    sudo mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
    ```

* Install with a package manager (Ubuntu/Debain):

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y kubectl
    ```

* Install with a package manager (CentOS/RHEL/Fedora):

    ```bash
    sudo yum install -y kubectl
    ```

### Install Helm

The Helm CLI is the tool for interacting with Helm and managing charts. Replicated recommends that all applications distributed with the Replicated Platform are packaged with Helm. Helm charts distributed with Replicated can also be installed in customer environments using Helm. Installing the Helm CLI on your workstation is important for being able to test and troubleshoot installations with Helm.

For more information, see [Installing Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) in the Helm documentation.

#### Mac

To install the Helm CLI on Mac, do one of the following:

* Install with Homebrew:

    ```bash
    brew install helm
    ```

* Or the official installation script that works across platforms:

    ```bash
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash
    ```

#### Linux

To install the Helm CLI on Linux:

```bash
curl -LO https://get.helm.sh/helm-v3.12.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar -zxvf helm-v3.12.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo mv linux-amd64/helm /usr/local/bin/helm
```

###  Install and Authorize the Replicated CLI

The Replicated CLI is the primary interface for the Replicated Platform. With the Replicated CLI, you can create and manage applications, releases, channels, customers, and more. You also use the Replicated CLI to create clusters with the Compatibility Matrix.

After installing, you can authorize the Replicated CLI by logging in to your Replicated vendor account through the `replicated login` command.

For more information about installing and authorizing the Replicated CLI, see [Install the Replicated CLI](/reference/replicated-cli-installing).

### Install the Preflight and Support Bundle CLIs

The preflight and support-bundle plugins available through the open source Troubleshoot project provide important troubleshooting tools for your customers, allowing them to run preflight checks and collect support bundles. For more information, see [About Preflight Checks and Support Bundles](/vendor/preflight-support-bundle-about).

These instructions shows you how to install the Troubleshoot plugins using Krew. For more information about installing the preflight and support-bundle plugins, including other installation options, see [Getting Started](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/) in the Troubleshoot documentation.

To install the preflight and support-bundle plugins:

1. Install Krew:

    * **Mac:** 
      ```bash
      brew install krew
      ```
    * **Other operating systems:**
      ```bash
      (
        set -x; cd "$(mktemp -d)" &&
        OS="$(uname | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')" &&
        ARCH="$(uname -m | sed -e 's/x86_64/amd64/' -e 's/\(arm\)\(64\)\?.*/\1\2/' -e 's/aarch64$/arm64/')" &&
        KREW="krew-${OS}_${ARCH}" &&
        curl -fsSLO "https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/krew/releases/latest/download/${KREW}.tar.gz" &&
        tar zxvf "${KREW}.tar.gz" &&
        ./"${KREW}" install krew
      )
      ``` 

1. After installing, add the krew binary directory to your PATH:

    ```bash
    echo 'export PATH="${KREW_ROOT:-$HOME/.krew}/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```

1. Run the following commands:

   ```bash
   kubectl krew install preflight
   kubectl krew install support-bundle
   ```

### Install sbctl

sbctl is a command-line tool that you can use to examine Kubernetes resources in support bundles. With sbctl, you can interact with the support bundle in a shell using kubectl commands to view and inspect resources.

For more information, see the [sbctl](https://github.com/replicatedhq/sbctl) repository in GitHub.

To install sbctl:

* **macOS Intel systems:**

    ```bash
    curl -LO https://github.com/replicatedhq/sbctl/releases/latest/download/sbctl_darwin_amd64.tar.gz
    tar -xzf sbctl_darwin_amd64.tar.gz -C /tmp sbctl
    rm -f sbctl_darwin_amd64.tar.gz
    sudo mv /tmp/sbctl /usr/local/bin/
    ```

* **macOS Apple Silicon:**
    ```bash
    curl -LO https://github.com/replicatedhq/sbctl/releases/latest/download/sbctl_darwin_arm64.tar.gz
    tar -xzf sbctl_darwin_arm64.tar.gz -C /tmp sbctl
    rm -f sbctl_darwin_arm64.tar.gz
    sudo mv /tmp/sbctl /usr/local/bin/
    ```

* **Linux x86_64:**
    ```bash
    curl -LO https://github.com/replicatedhq/sbctl/releases/latest/download/sbctl_linux_amd64.tar.gz
    tar -xzf sbctl_linux_amd64.tar.gz -C /tmp sbctl
    rm -f sbctl_linux_amd64.tar.gz
    sudo mv /tmp/sbctl /usr/local/bin/
    ```

* **Linux ARM64:**
    ```bash
    curl -LO https://github.com/replicatedhq/sbctl/releases/latest/download/sbctl_linux_arm64.tar.gz
    tar -xzf sbctl_linux_arm64.tar.gz -C /tmp sbctl
    rm -f sbctl_linux_arm64.tar.gz
    sudo mv /tmp/sbctl /usr/local/bin/
    ```

### (Recommended) Install Data Processing Tools

Replicated recommends that you install the following tools for parsing and manipulating JSON and YAML data when working with Kubernetes and Replicated configurations:
* [jq](https://jqlang.org/) for JSON processing
* [yq](https://mikefarah.gitbook.io/yq/) for YAML manipulation

These tools transform complex data manipulation tasks from multi-step processes into single commands, making your development workflow significantly more efficient.

* To install jq:

    ```bash
    # macOS
    brew install jq

    # Ubuntu/Debian
    sudo apt-get install jq

    # CentOS/RHEL/Fedora
    sudo yum install jq

    # Or download directly
    curl -LO https://github.com/stedolan/jq/releases/latest/download/jq-linux64
    chmod +x jq-linux64
    sudo mv jq-linux64 /usr/local/bin/jq
    ```

* To install yq:

    ```bash
    # macOS
    brew install yq

    # Linux
    curl -LO https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/releases/latest/download/yq_linux_amd64
    chmod +x yq_linux_amd64
    sudo mv yq_linux_amd64 /usr/local/bin/yq

    # Or using go install
    go install github.com/mikefarah/yq/v4@latest
    ```

## Set Up Development Environments for Testing {#dev}

Testing your releases is an important part of the commercial software distribution lifecycle. Replicated recommends that you have access to a virtual machine (VM) and a cluster where you can deploy your releases for testing.

### Create a VM

To test installations and updates with the Replicated Embedded Cluster installer, create a VM that meets Embedded Cluster's requirements:

<Requirements/>

### Create a Cluster

To test installations with Helm, you need kubectl access to a cluster.

You can use any cloud provider or tool that you prefer to create a cluster, such as [Replicated Compatibility Matrix](/vendor/testing-how-to), Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), or minikube.

For information about how to create a cluster with Compatibility Matrix, see [Prerequisites](/vendor/testing-how-to#prerequisites) and [Create Clusters](/vendor/testing-how-to#create-clusters) in _Use Compatibility Matrix_.
