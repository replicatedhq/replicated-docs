# Set Up Your Environment

This topic describes how to set up your environment to get started with the Replicated Platform. It includes information about installing the required tools on your local workstation as well as creating development environments for testing installation and upgrade scenarios for your application.

## Set Up Your Local Workstation {#local}

This section lists the tools that you need to install on your local workstation to manage applications, releases, customers, and more with the Replicated Platform.

### Install kubectl

kubectl is the Kubernetes command line tool. You will use kubectl to communicate with the clusters that you create with the Replicated Compatibility Matrix, and when testing and troubleshooting installations in existing clusters. For more information about kubectl, see [Command line tool (kubectl)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/) in the Kubernetes documentation.

#### Mac

To install kubectl on Mac, do one of the following:

* Install with Homebrew:
    ```bash
    brew install kubectl
    ```
* Install using curl:

    ```bash
    curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/darwin/amd64/kubectl"
    chmod +x ./kubectl
    sudo mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
    ```

### Install the Preflight and Support Bundle Plugins

The preflight and support-bundle plugins available through the open source Troubleshoot project provide important troubleshooting tools for your customers, allowing them to run preflight checks and collect support bundles. For more information, see [About Preflight Checks and Support Bundles](/vendor/preflight-support-bundle-about).

These instructions show you how to install the Troubleshoot plugins using Krew. For more information about installing the preflight and support-bundle plugins, including other installation options, see [Getting Started](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/) in the Troubleshoot documentation.

To install the preflight and support-bundle plugins:

1. Install Krew:

    * Mac: 
      ```bash
      brew install krew
      ```
    * Other operating systems:
      ```bash
      (
        set -x; cd "$(mktemp -d)" &&
        OS="$(uname | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')" &&
        ARCH="$(uname -m | sed -e 's/x86_64/amd64/' -e 's/\(arm\)\(64\)\?.*/\1\2/' -e 's/aarch64$/arm64/')" &&
        KREW="krew-${OS}_${ARCH}" &&
        curl -fsSLO "https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/krew/releases/latest/download/${KREW}.tar.gz" &&
        tar zxvf "${KREW}.tar.gz" &&
        ./"${KREW}" install krew
      )
      ``` 

1. After installing, add the krew binary directory to your PATH:

    ```bash
    echo 'export PATH="${KREW_ROOT:-$HOME/.krew}/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```

1. Run the following commands:

   ```bash
   kubectl krew install preflight
   kubectl krew install support-bundle
   ```

### Install sbctl

sbctl is a command-line tool that makes it easier to troubleshoot an installation using a support bundle. With sbctl, you provide a support bundle that was collected in a cluster. sbctl then generates a kubeconfig file based on the contents of the support bundle an opens an interactive shell. In the sbctl shell, you can run kubectl commands to interact with a representation of the state of the cluster when the support bundle was collected.

For more information, see the [sbctl](https://github.com/replicatedhq/sbctl) repository in GitHub.

To install sbctl, run one of the following commands:

* macOS Intel systems:

    ```bash
    curl -LO https://github.com/replicatedhq/sbctl/releases/latest/download/sbctl_darwin_amd64.tar.gz
    tar -xzf sbctl_darwin_amd64.tar.gz -C /tmp sbctl
    rm -f sbctl_darwin_amd64.tar.gz
    sudo mv /tmp/sbctl /usr/local/bin/
    ```

* macOS Apple Silicon:
    ```bash
    curl -LO https://github.com/replicatedhq/sbctl/releases/latest/download/sbctl_darwin_arm64.tar.gz
    tar -xzf sbctl_darwin_arm64.tar.gz -C /tmp sbctl
    rm -f sbctl_darwin_arm64.tar.gz
    sudo mv /tmp/sbctl /usr/local/bin/
    ```

* Linux x86_64:
    ```bash
    curl -LO https://github.com/replicatedhq/sbctl/releases/latest/download/sbctl_linux_amd64.tar.gz
    tar -xzf sbctl_linux_amd64.tar.gz -C /tmp sbctl

    sudo mv /tmp/sbctl /usr/local/bin/
    ```

* Linux ARM64:
    ```bash
    curl -LO https://github.com/replicatedhq/sbctl/releases/latest/download/sbctl_linux_arm64.tar.gz
    tar -xzf sbctl_linux_arm64.tar.gz -C /tmp sbctl
    rm -f sbctl_linux_arm64.tar.gz
    sudo mv /tmp/sbctl /usr/local/bin/
    ```

### (Recommended) Install Data Processing Tools

Replicated recommends that you install the following tools for parsing and manipulating JSON and YAML data:
* [jq](https://jqlang.org/) for JSON processing
* [yq](https://mikefarah.gitbook.io/yq/) for YAML manipulation

These tools are useful when working with Kubernetes and Replicated configurations to reduce complex data manipulation tasks from multi-step processes into single commands, simplifying your development workflow.

* To install jq, run one of the following commands:

    * macOS:
      ```bash
      brew install jq
      ```
    * Ubuntu/Debian:
      ```bash
      sudo apt-get install jq
      ```
    * CentOS/RHEL/Fedora"   
      ```bash
      sudo yum install jq
      ```
    * Direct download:  
      ```bash
      curl -LO https://github.com/stedolan/jq/releases/latest/download/jq-linux64
      chmod +x jq-linux64
      sudo mv jq-linux64 /usr/local/bin/jq
      ```

* To install yq, run one of the following commands:
    * macOS:
      ```bash
      brew install yq
      ```
    * Linux:
      ```bash
      curl -LO https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/releases/latest/download/yq_linux_amd64
      chmod +x yq_linux_amd64
      sudo mv yq_linux_amd64 /usr/local/bin/yq
      ```
    * Go install:
      ```bash
      go install github.com/mikefarah/yq/v4@latest
      ```

## Set Up Development Environments for Testing {#dev}

Testing your releases is an important part of the commercial software distribution lifecycle. Replicated recommends that you have access to a virtual machine (VM) and a cluster where you can install your application releases for testing.

### About Creating a VM

You need access to a VM to test installations and updates with the Replicated Embedded Cluster installer. For more information about Embedded Cluster, see [Embedded Cluster Overview](/vendor/embedded-overview).

Your VM must meet the following requirements to install with Embedded Cluster:

<Requirements/>

### About Creating a Cluster

To test installations with Helm, you need kubectl access to a cluster.

You can use any cloud provider or tool that you prefer to create a cluster, such as [Replicated Compatibility Matrix](/vendor/testing-how-to), Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), or minikube.

For information about how to create a cluster with Compatibility Matrix, see [Prerequisites](/vendor/testing-how-to#prerequisites) and [Create Clusters](/vendor/testing-how-to#create-clusters) in _Use Compatibility Matrix_.
