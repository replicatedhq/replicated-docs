# Access a Customer's Download Portal

This topic describes how to access installation instructions and download installation assets (such as customer license files and air gap bundles) from the Replicated Download Portal.

For information about downloading air gap bundles and licenses with the Vendor API v3, see the following pages in the Vendor API v3 documentation:
* [Download a customer license file as YAML](https://replicated-vendor-api.readme.io/reference/downloadlicense)
* [Trigger airgap build for a channel's release](https://replicated-vendor-api.readme.io/reference/channelreleaseairgapbuild)
* [Get airgap bundle download URL for the active release on the channel](https://replicated-vendor-api.readme.io/reference/channelreleaseairgapbundleurl)

## Overview

The Replicated Download Portal can be used to share license files, air gap bundles, and other assets with customers. From the Download Portal, customers can also view instructions for how to install a release with Replicated Embedded Cluster or the Helm CLI.

A unique Download Portal link is available for each customer. The Download Portal uses information from the customer's license to make the relevant assets and installation instructions available.

## Limitation

Sessions in the Download Portal are valid for 72 hours. After the session expires, your customer must log in again. The Download Portal session length is not configurable.

## Access the Download Portal

To access the Download Portal for a customer:

1. In the [Vendor Portal](https://vendor.replicated.com), on the **Customers** page, click on the name of the customer.

1. On the **Manage customer** tab, under **Install types**, enable the installation types that are supported for the customer. This determines the installation instructions and assets that are available for the customer in the Download Portal. For more information about install types, see [Manage Install Types for a License](/vendor/licenses-install-types).
