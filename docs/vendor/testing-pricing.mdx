# Compatibility Matrix Pricing

This topic describes the pricing for Replicated Compatibility Matrix.

## Pricing Overview

Compatibility Matrix usage-based pricing includes a $0.50 per cluster startup cost, plus by the minute pricing based on instance size and count (starting at the time the cluster state changed to "running" and ending when the cluster is either expired (TTL) or removed). Minutes will be rounded up, so there will be a minimum charge of $0.50 plus 1 minute for all running clusters. Each cluster's cost will be rounded up to the nearest cent and subtracted from the available credits in the account and viewable on the Replicated Vendor Portal [Cluster History](https://vendor.replicated.com/compatibility-matrix/history) page.

If the team's available credits are insufficient to run the cluster for the full duration of the TTL, the cluster creation will be rejected.

## Cluster Quotas

Each team is limited by the number of clusters that they can run concurrently. To increase the quota, reach out to your account manager.

## VM Cluster Pricing (Openshift, RKE2, K3s, Kind, Embedded Cluster, kURL)

VM-based clusters approximately match the AWS m6.i instance type pricing.
