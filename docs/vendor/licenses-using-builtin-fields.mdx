# Built-In License Fields

This topic describes the built-in license fields that appear customer licenses for applications distributed with Replicated.

## Overview

The license associated with each customer record in the Replicated Vendor Portal includes several built-in fields. These built-in fields include customer properties (such as the customer name, customer email, and the Vendor Portal channel where the customer is assigned), the license expiration date, as well as the Replicated features that are enabled for the customer (such as the supported install types or Admin Console features).

When a customer installs an application distributed with Replicated, the values for each built-in and custom field in their license can be accessed using the [Replicated SDK](/vendor/replicated-sdk-overview) in-cluster API [license](/reference/replicated-sdk-apis#license) endpoints. Applications installed with a Replicated installer (KOTS, kURL, Embedded Cluster) can also access license fields using the Replicated KOTS [LicenseFieldValue](/reference/template-functions-license-context#licensefieldvalue) template function.

The following shows an example of a customer license:

```yaml
apiVersion: kots.io/v1beta1
kind: License

  name: customertest

  appSlug: gitea

    isSemverRequired: true
