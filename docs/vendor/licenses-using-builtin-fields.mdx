# Working with Built-in License Fields

This topic describes the built-in license fields that are available when creating a customer in the Replicated Vendor Portal. It also includes information about how to set default values for the built-in license fields.

## Set Initial Values for Built-In License Fields (Beta)

You can set the initial values that will populate the **Create Customer** form in the Vendor Portal when a new customer is created. This ensures that each new customer created from the Vendor Portal UI starts with the same set of built-in license field values.

These initial values that you can set for built-in license fields differ from default values in that setting initial values does not update the license field values for any existing customers.

:::note
Initial values set in the Vendor Portal UI are not applied to new customers created through the Vendor API.
:::

To set inital values for the built-in license fields:

1. In the Vendor Portal, go to **License Fields**.

1. Under **Built-in license options**, click **Edit** next to each license field where you want to set an initial value.

## Built-In License fields

Built-in fields are reserved field names. The table below describes each built-in license field.
