# Working with Built-in License Fields

This topic describes the built-in license fields that are available when creating a customer in the Replicated Vendor Portal. It also includes information about how to set initial values for the built-in license fields.

## Set Initial Values for Built-In License Fields (Beta)

You can set initial values to populate the **Create Customer** form in the Vendor Portal when a new customer is created. This ensures that each new customer created from the Vendor Portal UI starts with the same set of built-in license field values.

:::note
Initial values are not applied to new customers created through the Vendor API v3. For more information, see [Create a customer](https://replicated-vendor-api.readme.io/reference/createcustomer-1) in the Vendor API v3 documentation.
:::

These _initial_ values differ from _default_ values in that setting initial values does not update the license field values for any existing customers.

To set inital values for built-in license fields:

1. In the Vendor Portal, go to **License Fields**.

1. Under **Built-in license options**, click **Edit** next to each license field where you want to set an initial value.

## Built-In License Fields

Built-in license fields are reserved field names. You can interact with built-in license fields using the Vendor API v3 and the Replicated SDK API. For more information, see [customers](https://replicated-vendor-api.readme.io/reference/getcustomerentitlements) in the Vendor API v3 documentation and [license](/reference/replicated-sdk-apis#license) in _SDK API_.
