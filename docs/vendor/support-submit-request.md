# Submit a Support Request

You can submit a support request and a support bundle using the Replicated Vendor Portal. Uploading a support bundle is secure and helps the Replicated support team troubleshoot your application faster. Severity 1 issues are resolved three times faster when you submit a support bundle with your support request.

### Prerequisites

The following prerequisites must be met to submit support requests:

* Your Vendor Portal account must be configured for access to support before you can submit support requests. Contact your administrator to ensure that you are added to the correct team.

* Your team must have a replicated-collab repository configured. If you are a team administrator and need information about getting a collab repository set up and adding users, see [Adding Users to the Collab Repository](team-management-github-username#add).
