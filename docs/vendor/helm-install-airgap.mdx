# Install and Update with Helm in Air Gap Environments

This topic describes how to install and update releases with Helm in air-gapped environments.

## Overview

Replicated supports installing and updating with Helm in _air-gapped_ environments with little or no outbound internet access. In air gap installations with Helm, customers are guided through the installation process with instructions provided in either the [Replicated Enterprise Portal](/vendor/enterprise-portal-about) or the [Replicated Download Portal](/vendor/releases-share-download-portal), depending on which is enabled for the customer.

These instructions assume that the customer is logged in to the portal on a workstation that can access both the internet and their internal private image registry. Direct access to the target installation cluster is not required. The instructions also assume that the customer is familiar with `curl`, `docker`, `helm`, and `kubernetes`, and that they have some familiarity with `bash`, particularly for automating updates.

## Prerequisites

Before you install, complete the following prerequisites:

* Declare the SDK as a dependency in your Helm chart. For more information, see [Install the SDK as a Subchart](replicated-sdk-installing#install-the-sdk-as-a-subchart) in _Installing the Replicated SDK_.

* Configure the HelmChart custom resource `builder` key. This ensures that the Vendor Portal can template the chart to discover the full list of container images required to install the chart in an air-gapped environment. The Vendor Portal uses this list of required images to create the Helm air gap installation instructions for the customer. For more information, see [builder](/reference/custom-resource-helmchart-v2#builder) in _HelmChart v2_. 

* The customer used to install must have the following:

     * A valid email address. This email address is only used as a username for the Replicated registry and is never contacted. For more information, see [Creating a Customer](/vendor/releases-creating-customer).

     * The **Existing Cluster (Helm CLI)** install type enabled. For more information, see [Manage Install Types for a License](licenses-install-types).

     * The **Helm CLI Air Gap Instructions** install option enabled.

## Install

Helm air gap installation instructions are provided in either the Enterprise Portal or the Download Portal, depending on which is enabled for the customer.

For more information about enabling the Enterprise Portal for a customer, see [Manage Enterprise Portal Access](/vendor/enterprise-portal-invite).

### Enterprise Portal (Beta)

To install with Helm in an air gap environment using the Enterprise Portal:

1. In the [Vendor Portal](https://vendor.replicated.com), go to **Customers > [Customer Name] > Reporting**.

1. In the **Enterprise portal** section, click **Visit** to log in to the portal.

1. In the Enterprise Portal, go to the **Install** tab then click **Helm** in the left nav.

1. On the first page of the installation wizard, complete any pre-install instructions. If the vendor did not include any custom pre-install instructions, continue to the next step.

1. Complete the following fields and then click **Continue**:

     * **Instance Name**: Enter a name for the instance.
     * **Kubernetes Distribution**: Select the Kubernetes distribution of the cluster where you will install.
     * **Cluster Network Availability**: Select the network availability of the cluster. For air gap installations, select **No outbound requests allowed (air gap)**.
     * **Registry Access**: Select the option that describes your current workstation's access to the internal image registry where you will push application images during installation. For air gap installations, select either **My workstation can only access the internet AND the registry (NOT the cluster)** or **I need to download artifacts and transfer them for offline installation**.

     The following shows an example of the Helm air gap installation instructions in the Enterprise Portal:

1. On the **Helm Air Gap Install** page, follow the instructions provided to install the chart and then click **Continue**.

1. On the last page of the installation wizard, complete any custom post-installation instructions for the application.

### Download Portal

To install with Helm in an air gap environment using the Download Portal:

1. In the [Vendor Portal](https://vendor.replicated.com), go to **Customers > [Customer Name] > Reporting**.

1. In the **Download portal** section, click **Visit download portal** to log in to the portal.

1. In the Download Portal left nav, click **Existing cluster with Helm**.

1. On the **Install** tab, in the **App version** dropdown, select the target application version to install.

1. Run the first command to authenticate into the Replicated proxy registry with the customer's credentials (the `license_id`).

1. Under **Get the list of images**, run the command provided to generate the list of images needed to install.

1. For **(Optional) Specify registry URI**, provide the URI for an internal image registry where you want to push images. If a registry URI is provided, Replicatd automatically updates the commands for tagging and pushing images with the URI.    

1. For **Pull, tag, and push each image to your private registry**, copy and paste the docker commands provided to pull, tag, and push each image to your internal registry.

    :::note
    If you did not provide a URI in the previous step, ensure that you manually replace the image names in the `tag` and `push` commands with the target registry URI.
    :::

1. Run the command to authenticate into the OCI registry that contains your Helm chart.

1. Run the command to install the `preflight` plugin. This allows you to run preflight checks before installing to ensure that the installation environment meets the requirements for the application.

1. For **Download a copy of the values.yaml file** and **Edit the values.yaml file**, run the `helm show values` command provided to download the values file for the Helm chart. Then, edit the values file as needed to customize the configuration of the given chart.

    If you are installing a release that contains multiple Helm charts, repeat these steps to download and edit each values file.

    :::note
    For installations with mutliple charts where two or more of the top-level charts in the release use the same name, ensure that each values file has a unique name to avoid installation error. For more information, see [Installation Fails for Release With Multiple Helm Charts](helm-install-troubleshooting#air-gap-values-file-conflict) in _Troubleshooting Helm Installations_.
    :::

1. For **Determine install method**, select one of the options depending on your ability to access the internet and the cluster from your workstation.

1. Use the commands provided and the values file or files that you edited to run preflight checks and then install the release.

## Perform Updates

This section describes the processes of performing manual and automatic updates with Helm in air gap environments using the instructions provided in the Enterprise Portal or the Download Portal.

### Manual Updates

The manual update instructions provided in the Enterprise Portal or Download Portal are similar to the installation instructions.

However, the first step prompts the customer to select their current version an the target version to install. This step takes [required releases](/vendor/releases-about#properties) into consideration, thereby guiding the customer to the versions that are upgradable from their current version. 

The additional steps are consistent with installation process until the `preflight` and `install` commands where customers provide the existing values from the cluster with the `helm get values` command. Your customer will then need to edit the `values.yaml` to reference the new image tags.

If the new version introduces new images or other values, Replicated recommends that you explain this at the top of your release notes so that customers know they will need to make additional edits to the `values.yaml` before installing. 

### Automate Updates (Download Portal Only)

The instructions in the Download Portal for automating updates use API endpoints that your customers can automate against. 

The instructions provide customers with example commands that can be put into a script that they run periodically (nightly, weekly) using GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or other platforms.

This method assumes that the customer has already done a successful manual installation, including the configuration of the appropriate `values`.

After logging into the registry, the customer exports their current version and uses that to query an endpoint that provides the latest installable version number (either the next required release, or the latest release) and export it as the target version. With the target version, they can now query an API for the list of images. 

With the list of images the provided `bash` script will automate the process of pulling updated images from the repository, tagging them with a name for an internal registry, and then pushing the newly tagged images to their internal registry. 

Unless the customer has set up the `values` to preserve the updated tag (for example, by using the `latest` tag), they need to edit the `values.yaml` to reference the new image tags. After doing so, they can log in to the OCI registry and perform the commands to install the updated chart.

## Use a Harbor or Artifactory Registry Proxy

You can integrate the Replicated proxy registry with an existing Harbor or jFrog Artifactory instance to proxy and cache images on demand. For more information, see [Using a Registry Proxy for Helm Air Gap Installations](using-third-party-registry-proxy).
