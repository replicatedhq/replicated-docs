# About Embedded Cluster Host Preflight Checks

This topic describes the host preflight checks that run as part of installation with Emebdded Cluster, including information about how to skip host preflights.

## Overview

During installation, Embedded Cluster automatically runs a default set of _host preflight checks_. The default host preflight checks are designed to verify that the installation environment meets the requirements for Embedded Cluster, such as:
* The system has sufficient disk space
* The system has at least 2G of memory and 2 CPU cores
* The system clock is synchronized

For Embedded Cluster requirements, see [Requirements](#requirements). For the full default host preflight spec for Embedded Cluster, see [`host-preflight.yaml`](https://github.com/replicatedhq/embedded-cluster/blob/main/pkg/preflights/host-preflight.yaml) in the `embedded-cluster` repository in GitHub.

If any of the host preflight checks fail, installation is blocked and a message describing the failure is displayed. For more information about host preflight checks for installations on VMs or bare metal servers, see [About Host Preflights](preflight-support-bundle-about#host-preflights).

## Limitations

Embedded Cluster host preflight checks have the following limitations:

* The default host preflight checks for Embedded Cluster cannot be modified, and vendors cannot provide their own custom host preflight spec for Embedded Cluster.
* Host preflight checks do not check that any application-specific requirements are met. For more information about defining preflight checks for your application, see [Defining Preflight Checks](/vendor/preflight-defining).

## Skip Host Preflight Checks

You can skip host preflight checks by passing the `--skip-host-preflights` flag with the Embedded Cluster `install` command. For example:

```bash
sudo ./my-app install --license license.yaml --skip-host-preflights
```

When you skip host preflight checks, the Admin Console still runs any application-specific preflight checks that are defined in the release before the application is deployed.

:::note
Skipping host preflight checks is _not_ recommended for production installations.
