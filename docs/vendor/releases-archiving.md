# Archiving Releases

You can archive releases to remove them from view on the Releases page.

Archiving a release that has been promoted does not remove the release from the channel's Release History page or prevent the app manager from downloading the archived release.

To archive one or more releases:

1. From the Releases page, click the trash can icon in the upper right corner.
1. Select one or more releases.
1. Click **Archive Releases**.
1. Confirm the archive action when prompted. Alternatively, click **Cancel** to cancel the archiving action.
