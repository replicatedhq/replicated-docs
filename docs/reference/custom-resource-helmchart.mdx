# HelmChart

HelmChart custom resources are required for the app manager to process and deploy Helm charts for the supported Helm installation types. For more information about Helm installation types, see [About Deploying Helm Charts](/vendor/helm-overview).

The HelmChart custom resource manifest file references a required `.tgz` export of the Helm chart resources and provides the necessary instructions for processing and preparing the chart for deployment. To deploy multiple instances of the same Helm chart, you must add an additional HelmChart custom resource for each instance. However, only one `.tgz` of the Helm chart needs to be included in the release.

## Example

The following is an example manifest file for the HelmChart custom resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: kots.io/v1beta1
kind: HelmChart
metadata:
  name: samplechart
spec:
  # chart identifies a matching chart from a .tgz
  chart:
    name: samplechart
    chartVersion: 3.1.7
    releaseName: samplechart-release-1

  exclude: "repl{{ ConfigOptionEquals `include_chart` `include_chart_no`}}"

  # helmVersion identifies the Helm Version used to render the chart. Default is v3.
  helmVersion: v3

  # useHelmInstall identifies whether this Helm chart will use the
  # Replicated Helm installation (false) or native Helm installation (true). Default is false.
  # Native Helm installations are only available for Helm v3 charts.
  useHelmInstall: true

  # weight determines the order that charts with "useHelmInstall: true" are applied, with lower weights first.
  weight: 42

  # helmUpgradeFlags specifies additional flags to pass to the `helm upgrade` command.
  helmUpgradeFlags:
    - --skip-crds
    - --no-hooks
    - --timeout
    - 1200s
    - --history-max=15

  # values are used in the customer environment, as a pre-render step
  # these values will be supplied to helm template
  values:
    postgresql:
      enabled: repl{{ ConfigOptionEquals `postgres_type` `embedded_postgres`}}

  optionalValues:
    - when: "repl{{ ConfigOptionEquals `postgres_type` `external_postgres`}}"
      recursiveMerge: false
      values:
        postgresql:
          postgresqlDatabase: "repl{{ if ConfigOptionEquals `postgres_type` `external_postgres`}}repl{{ ConfigOption `external_postgres_database`}}repl{{ end}}"
          postgresqlUsername: "repl{{ if ConfigOptionEquals `postgres_type` `external_postgres`}}repl{{ ConfigOption `external_postgres_username`}}repl{{ end}}"
          postgresqlHost: "repl{{ if ConfigOptionEquals `postgres_type` `external_postgres`}}repl{{ ConfigOption `external_postgres_host`}}repl{{ end}}"
          postgresqlPassword: "repl{{ if ConfigOptionEquals `postgres_type` `external_postgres`}}repl{{ ConfigOption `external_postgres_password`}}repl{{ end}}"
          postgresqlPort: "repl{{ if ConfigOptionEquals `postgres_type` `external_postgres`}}repl{{ ConfigOption `external_postgres_port`}}repl{{ end}}"

  # namespace allows for a chart to be installed in an alternate namespace to
  # the default
  namespace: samplechart-namespace

  # builder values provide a way to render the chart with all images
  # and manifests. this is used in Replicated to create `.airgap` packages
  builder:
    postgresql:
      enabled: true
```

## chart

The `chart` key allows for a mapping between the data in this definition and the chart archive itself.
More than one `kind: HelmChart` can reference a single chart archive, if different settings are needed.

### chart.name
The name of the chart. This value must match the `name` field from a `Chart.yaml` in a `.tgz` chart archive that is also included in the release.

### chart.chartVersion
The version of the chart. This value must match the `version` field from a `Chart.yaml` in a `.tgz` chart archive that is also included in the release.

### chart.releaseName

> Introduced in Replicated app manager v1.73.0

Specifies the release name to use when installing this instance of the Helm chart.
Defaults to the chart name.

The release name must be unique across all charts deployed in the namespace. To deploy multiple instances of the same Helm chart in a release, you must add an additional HelmChart custom resource with a unique release name for each instance of the Helm chart.

Must be a valid Helm release name that matches regex `^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?(\\.[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?)*$` and is no longer than 53 characters.

## helmVersion

Identifies the Helm Version used to render the chart. Acceptable values are `v2` or `v3`. `v3` is the default when no value is specified, and `v3` is required for native Helm installations.

:::note
<VersionLimitation/>
:::

## useHelmInstall

Identifies whether this Helm chart will use the Replicated Helm installation (`false`) or native Helm installation (`true`). Replicated recommends that you set this to `true` because native Helm is the preferred method. **Default:** `false`

Native Helm can only be set for new charts. Modifying this flag in existing charts for existing applications is not supported because charts installed with Replicated Helm cannot be migrated to native Helm. However, you can add native Helm charts to an existing release that already uses Replicated Helm. Each chart is installed using the specified installation method for that chart, indicated by the value of the `useHelmInstall` flag.

Native Helm installations always deploy using Helm v3.

## weight

Determines the order to apply charts that have `useHelmInstall: true`. Charts are applied by weight in ascending order, with lower weights applied first. **Supported values:** Positive or negative integers. **Default:** `0`

> Introduced in KOTS 1.99.0

When undeploying the application, charts are uninstalled by weight in descending order, with higher weights uninstalled first.

For more information, see [Defining Installation Order for Native Helm Charts](/vendor/helm-native-helm-install-order).

## helmUpgradeFlags

:::note
`helmUpgradeFlags` is available in the app manager v1.75.0 and later.
:::

Specifies additional flags to pass to the `helm upgrade` command for charts that have `useHelmInstall: true`. These flags are passed in addition to any flags the app manager passes by default. The values specified here take precedence if the app manager already passes the same flag. The `helmUpgradeFlags` attribute can be parsed by template functions. For more information about template functions, see [About template function contexts](template-functions-about).

The app manager uses `helm upgrade` for _all_ deployments of an application, not just upgrades, by specifying the `--install` flag. For non-boolean flags that require an additional argument, such as `--timeout 1200s`, you must use an equal sign (`=`) or specify the additional argument separately in the array. 

**Example:**

```yaml
helmUpgradeFlags:
  - --timeout
  - 1200s
  - --history-max=15
```

## values

The `values` key allows for values to be changed in the chart. It also can create a mapping between the Replicated admin console configuration screen and the values. This mapping makes it possible to use the configuration screen in the admin console to control the Helm `values.yaml` file. For more information about the configuration screen, see [About the Configuration Screen](../vendor/config-screen-about).

The keys below `values` must map exactly to the keys in your `values.yaml`.
Only include the keys below `values` that you want to change. These are merged with the `values.yaml` in the chart archive.

To exclude a value that is set in the Helm chart `values.yaml`, set the value equal to the string `"null"` (with quotes) in the `values` section of the HelmChart custom resource.

For more options, see the [Allow deletion of a previous values file key](https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/2648) pull request in the Helm repository in GitHub.

## exclude

The  attribute is a value for making optional charts. The `exclude` attribute can be parsed by template functions. 

When the app manager processes Helm charts, it excludes the entire chart if the output of the `exclude` field can be parsed as a boolean evaluating to `true`.

For more information about optional charts, template functions, and how app manager processes Helm charts, see:

* [Optional Charts](/vendor/helm-optional-charts)
* [About Template Function Contexts](template-functions-about)
* [Native Helm (Recommended)](/vendor/helm-overview#native)

## optionalValues

The `optionalValues` array supports advanced use cases where value overwrites must be dependent on a given condition evaluating to true.

Not all Helm charts treat `""` and missing as the same value. If you need to have a value set that is always optional, and an empty string does not provide the same functionality as "not set", use the `optionalValues` key.

For more information about using `optionalValues`, see [Including Optional Value Keys](/vendor/helm-optional-value-keys).

### optionalValues[].when

The `when` field in `optionalValues` provides a string-based method that is evaluated by template functions. The `when` field defers evaluation of the conditional to render time in the customer environment. 

To write the `when` conditional statement, use template functions. The following example shows a conditional statement for selecting a database option on the admin console configuration screen:

```yaml
optionalValues:
  - when: "repl{{ ConfigOptionEquals `postgres_type` `external_postgres`}}"
```  

For more information about using optional values, see [Configuring Optional Value Keys](/vendor/helm-optional-value-keys). 

For more information about the syntax for template functions, see [About Template Function Contexts](template-functions-about).

### optionalValues[].recursiveMerge

:::note
`recursiveMerge` is available in the app manager v1.38.0 and later.
:::

The `recursiveMerge` boolean defines how the app manager merges the `values` and `optionalValues` datasets when the conditional statement in the `when` field is `true`.

The admin console uses the values from this merged dataset and from the Helm chart `values.yaml` file when deploying the application. For an example of recursive merge, see [Example: Recursive Merge](/vendor/helm-optional-value-keys#example-recursive-merge) in _Configuring Optional Value Keys_.        

The following table describes how `values` and `optionalValues` are merged based on the value of the `recursiveMerge` boolean:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th width="30%">Value</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>false</code> (Default)</td>
    <td><p>The <code>values</code> and <code>optionalValues</code> fields from the HelmChart custom resource manifest are <em>not</em> merged recursively.</p>
    <p>The top level keys in <code>optionalValues</code> overwrite the top level keys in <code>values</code>.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>true</code></td>    
    <td><p>The <code>values</code> and <code>optionalValues</code> fields from the HelmChart custom resource manifest are merged recursively.</p>
    <p>All keys from <code>values</code> and <code>optionalValues</code> are included in the merged dataset.</p>
    <p>In the case of a conflict where there is a matching key in <code>optionalValues</code> and <code>values</code>, the merged dataset uses the value of the key from <code>optionalValues</code>.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## namespace

The `namespace` key specifies an alternative namespace where the app manager installs the Helm chart. **Default:** The Helm chart is installed in the same namespace as the admin console. The `namespace` attribute can be parsed by template functions. For more information about template functions, see [About template function contexts](template-functions-about).


If you specify a namespace in the HelmChart `namespace` field, you must also include the same namespace in the `additionalNamespaces` field of the Application custom resource manifest file. The app manager creates the namespaces listed in the `additionalNamespaces` field during installation. For more information, see [additionalNamespaces](custom-resource-application#additionalnamespaces) in the _Application_ reference.

## builder

To create an `.airgap` bundle for a release that uses Helm charts, the Replicated vendor portal renders templates of the Helm charts with `helm template`. The `builder` key specifies the values from the Helm chart `values.yaml` file that the vendor portal uses to create the `.airgap` bundle. For more information, see [Air Gap](/vendor/helm-overview#air-gap) in _About Deploying Helm Charts_.

<HelmBuilderRequirements/>

**Example:**

The following example demonstrates how to add a conditional `postgresql` resource to the `builder` key.

`postgresql` is defined as a conditional resource in the `values` key of the HelmChart custom resource:

```yaml
  values:
    postgresql:
      enabled: repl{{ ConfigOptionEquals `postgres_type` `embedded_postgres`}}
```
As shown above, `postgresql` is included only when the user selects the `embedded_postgres` option.

To ensure the vendor portal includes this conditional `postgresql` resource in `.airgap` bundles, add the same `postgresql` value to the `builder` key with `enabled` set to `true`:

```yaml
  builder:
    postgresql:
      enabled: true
```
