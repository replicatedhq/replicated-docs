## Overview

To install your application in an embedded cluster, an embedded cluster config must be created in a release. Embedded cluster binaries are available only for releases that include an embedded cluster config.

The embedded cluster config lets you define several aspects of the Kubernetes cluster that will be created.

**Example**:

```yaml
apiVersion: embeddedcluster.replicated.com/v1beta1
kind: Config
spec:
  version: 1.1.0+k8s-1.29
  roles:
    controller:
      name: management
      labels:
        management: "true"
    custom:
    - name: app
      labels:
       app: "true"
  extensions:
    helm:
      repositories:
        - name: ingress-nginx
          url: https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx
      charts:
        - name: ingress-nginx
          chartname: ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx
          namespace: ingress-nginx
          version: "4.8.3"
          values: |
            controller:
              service:
                type: NodePort
                nodePorts:
                  http: "80"
                  https: "443"
  unsupportedOverrides:
    k0s: |
      config:
        spec:
          api:
            extraArgs:
              service-node-port-range: 80-32767
```

## Version

You must specify which version of embedded cluster to install. Each version of embedded cluster includes particular versions of components like KOTS (admin console) and OpenEBS.

For a full list of versions, see the embedded cluster [releases page](https://github.com/replicatedhq/embedded-cluster/releases) in GitHub. It's recommended to keep this version as up to date as possible because embedded cluster is changing rapidly.

## Roles

You can define node roles in the embedded cluster config. Roles are particularly useful for multi-node clusters. One or more roles can be selected and assigned to a node when it is joined to the cluster. Node roles can be used to determine which nodes run the Kubernetes control plane, and to assign application workloads to particular nodes.

:::note
Roles are not updated or changed after a node is added. If you need to change a node’s role, reset the node and add it again.
:::

### Controller

The controller role is required in any cluster. Nodes with this role are “controller workers” because they run the control plane and can run other workloads too. The first node in a cluster will always have the controller role because a cluster needs a control plane. Any node that doesn't have the controller role is a worker node.

By default, the controller role is called “controller.” You can customize the name of the controller role with the `spec.roles.controller.name` field, like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: embeddedcluster.replicated.com/v1beta1
kind: Config
spec:
  roles:
    controller:
      name: management
```      

### Custom

You can define custom roles for other purposes in the cluster. This is particularly useful when combined with labels.

Custom roles are defined with the `spec.roles.custom` array, as shown in the example below:

```yaml
apiVersion: embeddedcluster.replicated.com/v1beta1
kind: Config
spec:
  roles:
    custom:
    - name: app
```

### Labels

Roles can have associated Kubernetes labels that are applied to any node in the cluster that is assigned that role. This is useful for things like assigning workloads to nodes.

Labels are defined for the controller role and custom roles, as shown in the example below:

```yaml
apiVersion: embeddedcluster.replicated.com/v1beta1
kind: Config
spec:
  roles:
    controller:
      name: management
      labels:
        management: "true" # Label applied to "management" nodes
    custom:
    - name: app
      labels:
        app: "true" # Label applied to "app" nodes
```

## Helm Extensions

If you need to install Helm charts before your application and as part of the embedded cluster itself, you can do this with Helm extensions. One situation where this is useful is if you want to ship an ingress controller, because embedded cluster does not yet include one.

Helm extensions are updated when new versions of your application are deployed from the admin console. So, for example, you can change the values for a Helm extension from one release to another, and those changes will be applied to the cluster when the new release is deployed.

**Limitation**: If a Helm extension is removed from the embedded cluster config, the associated Helm chart is not removed from the cluster. This is a limitation that we intend to address in the future.

The format for specifying Helm extensions uses the same k0s Helm extensions format from the k0s configuration. For more information about these fields, see the [k0s documentation](https://docs.k0sproject.io/head/helm-charts/#example).

The `version` field is required. Failing to specify a chart version will cause problems for upgrades.

**Example**:

```yaml
apiVersion: embeddedcluster.replicated.com/v1beta1
kind: Config
spec:
  extensions:
    helm:
      repositories:
        - name: ingress-nginx
          url: https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx
      charts:
        - name: ingress-nginx
          chartname: ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx
          namespace: ingress-nginx
          version: "4.8.3"
          values: |
            controller:
              service:
                type: NodePort
                nodePorts:
                  http: "80"
                  https: "443"
```

:::note
If an order is not provided, Helm extensions are installed with order 10. Numbers below 10 are reserved for use by embedded cluster to deploy things like a storage provider and the admin console. If you need to install multiple charts in a particular order, choose orders greater than or equal to 10.

## Unsupported Overrides

:::important
This feature should be used with caution by advanced users knowledgeable about k0s.
:::

Unsupported overrides allow you to override the default k0s config. This should be used with caution because changes here can disrupt or break embedded clusters.

Though somewhat dangerous, this section is useful if you need to make changes that are not yet otherwise exposed by embedded cluster.

For more information on the k0s config, see [Configuration options](https://docs.k0sproject.io/head/configuration/#full-config-reference) in the k0s documentation.

If you need to use unsupported overrides, let Alex Parker know! These overrides are not supported by Replicated, and reasonable modifications to the k0s config will be productized and incorporated directly into the embedded cluster config instead.

A common use case today is to adjust the default service port range to allow node ports on lower port numbers. This will likely be incorporated into the embedded cluster config in the future, but for now you can set it with unsupported overrides, as shown in the example below:

```yaml
apiVersion: embeddedcluster.replicated.com/v1beta1
kind: Config
spec:
  unsupportedOverrides:
    k0s: |
      config:
        spec:
          api:
            extraArgs:
              service-node-port-range: 80-32767
```

Overrides overwrite the corresponding fields in the k0s configuration. They are not merged into embedded cluster’s default configuration. When using overrides to override a list, for example, ensure that you include other elements in the list that embedded cluster includes by default.

### Overriding The Default Add-On Deployment Values

:::important
To utilize this feature, please ensure that you are using version v1.2.0 or later. If you are currently running an older version, you must first upgrade to v1.2.0 before proceeding.
:::

Each add-on deployed by the Embedded Cluster comes with a predefined set of values. In Helm terminology, these values are equivalent to those found in the `values.yaml` file used when deploying a Helm Chart.

To overwrite these default values, you can use the Embedded Cluster configuration by utilizing the `builtInExtensions` property on the `unsupportedOverrides` config section. For example, if you want to override the default values for the OpenEBS add-on, you can create a configuration file like the one shown below:

```yaml
apiVersion: embeddedcluster.replicated.com/v1beta1
kind: Config
metadata:
  name: my-cluster-config
spec:
  version: 1.2.0+k8s-1.29
  unsupportedOverrides:
    builtInExtensions:
    - name: openebs
      values: |
        key: value
```

In this configuration file, the fields specified in the `values` property will be merged with the Embedded Cluster default values for OpenEBS before the cluster is installed or upgraded. The `name` property indicates which add-on the values apply to. The available options for the `name` property are:

- `openebs`
- `embedded-cluster-operator`
- `velero`
- `admin-console`

This feature allows for greater flexibility and customisation of your add-on deployments. By specifying the `builtInExtensions` property, you can ensure that your add-ons are configured exactly as needed for your specific use case.
