## Overview

To install your application with Embedded Cluster, an Embedded Cluster Config must be created in a release. Embedded Cluster installation artifacts are available only for releases that include an Embedded Cluster Config.

The Embedded Cluster Config lets you define several aspects of the Kubernetes cluster that will be created.

### Limitations

* The Embedded Cluster Config does not support the use of Go template functions, including [KOTS template functions](/reference/template-functions-about).

For additional property-specific limitations, see the sections below.

### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: embeddedcluster.replicated.com/v1beta1
kind: Config
spec:
  version: 1.10.0+k8s-1.29
  roles:
    controller:
      name: management
      labels:
        management: "true"
    custom:
    - name: app
      labels:
       app: "true"
  extensions:
    helm:
      repositories:
        - name: ingress-nginx
          url: https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx
      charts:
        - name: ingress-nginx
          chartname: ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx
          namespace: ingress-nginx
          version: "4.8.3"
          values: |
            controller:
              service:
                type: NodePort
                nodePorts:
                  http: "80"
                  https: "443"
              # Known issue: Only use image tags for multi-architecture images.
              # Set digest to empty string to ensure the air gap builder uses
              # single-architecture images.
              image:
                digest: ""
                digestChroot: ""
              admissionWebhooks:
                patch:
                  image:
                    digest: ""
```

## version

You must specify which version of Embedded Cluster to install. Each version of Embedded Cluster includes particular versions of components like KOTS (Admin Console) and OpenEBS.

For a full list of versions, see the Embedded Cluster [releases page](https://github.com/replicatedhq/embedded-cluster/releases) in GitHub. It's recommended to keep this version as up to date as possible because Embedded Cluster is changing rapidly.

## roles

You can define node roles in the Embedded Cluster Config. Roles are particularly useful for multi-node clusters. One or more roles can be selected and assigned to a node when it is joined to the cluster. Node roles can be used to determine which nodes run the Kubernetes control plane, and to assign application workloads to particular nodes.

:::note
Roles are not updated or changed after a node is added. If you need to change a node’s role, reset the node and add it again.
:::

### controller

The controller role is required in any cluster. Nodes with this role are “controller workers” because they run the control plane and can run other workloads too. The first node in a cluster will always have the controller role because a cluster needs a control plane. Any node that doesn't have the controller role is a worker node.

By default, the controller role is called “controller.” You can customize the name of the controller role with the `spec.roles.controller.name` field, like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: embeddedcluster.replicated.com/v1beta1
kind: Config
spec:
  roles:
    controller:
      name: management
```      

### custom

You can define custom roles for other purposes in the cluster. This is particularly useful when combined with labels.

Custom roles are defined with the `spec.roles.custom` array, as shown in the example below:

```yaml
apiVersion: embeddedcluster.replicated.com/v1beta1
kind: Config
spec:
  roles:
    custom:
    - name: app
```

### labels

Roles can have associated Kubernetes labels that are applied to any node in the cluster that is assigned that role. This is useful for things like assigning workloads to nodes.

Labels are defined for the controller role and custom roles, as shown in the example below:

```yaml
apiVersion: embeddedcluster.replicated.com/v1beta1
kind: Config
spec:
  roles:
    controller:
      name: management
      labels:
        management: "true" # Label applied to "management" nodes
    custom:
    - name: app
      labels:
        app: "true" # Label applied to "app" nodes
```

## extensions

If you need to install Helm charts before your application and as part of the Embedded Cluster itself, you can do this with Helm extensions. One situation where this is useful is if you want to ship an ingress controller, because Embedded Cluster does not yet include one.

Helm extensions are updated when new versions of your application are deployed from the Admin Console. So, for example, you can change the values for a Helm extension from one release to another, and those changes will be applied to the cluster when the new release is deployed.

The format for specifying Helm extensions uses the same k0s Helm extensions format from the k0s configuration. For more information about these fields, see the [k0s documentation](https://docs.k0sproject.io/stable/helm-charts/#example).

### Limitation

If a Helm extension is removed from the Embedded Cluster Config, the associated Helm chart is not removed from the cluster.

### Requirements

* The `version` field is required. Failing to specify a chart version will cause problems for upgrades.

* If you need to install multiple charts in a particular order, set the `order` field to a value greater than or equal to 10. Numbers below 10 are reserved for use by Embedded Cluster to deploy things like a storage provider and the Admin Console. If an `order` is not provided, Helm extensions are installed with order 10. 

### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: embeddedcluster.replicated.com/v1beta1
kind: Config
spec:
  extensions:
    helm:
      repositories:
        - name: ingress-nginx
          url: https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx
      charts:
        - name: ingress-nginx
          chartname: ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx
          namespace: ingress-nginx
          version: "4.8.3"
          values: |
            controller:
              service:
                type: NodePort
                nodePorts:
                  http: "80"
                  https: "443"
              # Known issue: Only use image tags for multi-architecture images.
              # Set digest to empty string to ensure the air gap builder uses
              # single-architecture images.
              image:
                digest: ""
                digestChroot: ""
              admissionWebhooks:
                patch:
                  image:
                    digest: ""
```

## unsupportedOverrides

:::important
This feature should be used with caution by advanced users who understand the risks and ramifications of changing the default configuration.
:::

Unsupported overrides allow you to override Embedded Cluster's default configuration, including the k0s config and the Helm values for extensions like KOTS and OpenEBS. This should be used with caution because changes here are untested and can disrupt or break Embedded Clusters. Any issues that are caused by unsupported overrides are not supported.

While they should be used with caution, unsupported overrides are useful if you need to make changes that are not otherwise exposed by Embedded Cluster.

### Override the k0s Config

By default, Embedded Cluster uses a k0s config that is tested and known to work for Embedded Clusters. In some circumstances, you might want to change the k0s config.

For more information on the k0s config, see [Configuration options](https://docs.k0sproject.io/stable/configuration/#configuration-file-reference) in the k0s documentation.

For example, you can do the following to enable WireGuard-based encryption. Note that other configuration might be necessary. See [`spec.network.calico`](https://docs.k0sproject.io/stable/configuration/#specnetworkcalico) in the k0s documentation for more details.
```yaml
apiVersion: embeddedcluster.replicated.com/v1beta1
kind: Config
spec:
  unsupportedOverrides:
    k0s: |
      config:
        spec:
          network:
            calico:
              wireguard: true
```

#### Limtiations

* The `spec.api` and `spec.storage` keys in the k0s config cannot be changed after installation. Whereas most keys in the k0s config apply to the whole cluster, these two keys are set for each node. Embedded Cluster cannot update these keys on each individual node during updates, so they cannot be changed after installation.

* Overrides overwrite the corresponding fields in the k0s configuration. They are not merged into Embedded Cluster’s default configuration. When using overrides to override a list, for example, ensure that you include other elements in the list that Embedded Cluster includes by default.

### Override the Helm Values for Built-In Extensions

Embedded Cluster deploys built-in extensions like KOTS and OpenEBS to provide capabilities like storage and application management. These extensions are deployed with Helm, and the Helm values for each can be modified if necessary.

To modify these values, you can use the `unsupportedOverrides.builtInExtensions` key of the Embedded Cluster Config. Each chart you want to modify is an item in the array. The `name` key identifies the Helm chart that you want to modify, and the `values` key is a string where you specify your modified Helm values. Your modified values are merged into the values used by Embedded Cluster.

The following are the built-in extensions available for modification:

- `openebs`
- `admin-console`
- `velero`
- `embedded-cluster-operator`

#### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: embeddedcluster.replicated.com/v1beta1
kind: Config
spec:
  unsupportedOverrides:
    builtInExtensions:
    - name: openebs
      values: |
        key: value
```
