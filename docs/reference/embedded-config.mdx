# Embedded Cluster Config (Beta)

To use the embedded cluster, an embedded cluster config must be created in a release. The embedded cluster config lets you define several things about the cluster that will be created.

```yaml
apiVersion: embeddedcluster.replicated.com/v1beta1
kind: Config
spec:
  version: 1.29.1+ec.0
  roles:
    controller:
      name: management
      labels:
        management: "true"
    custom:
    - name: app
      labels:
       app: "true"

```
