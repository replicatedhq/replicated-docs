# customer archive

Archive a customer for the current application.

This command allows you to archive a customer record. Archiving a customer
will make their license inactive and remove them from active customer lists.
This action is reversible. You can unarchive a customer later if needed.

The customer can be specified by either their name or ID.

## Usage
```bash
replicated customer archive [CUSTOMER_NAME_OR_ID]
```

<table>
  <tr>
    <th width="30%">Flag</th>
    <th width="20%">Type (if applicable)</th>
    <th width="50%">Description</th>
  </tr>
  <Help/>
  <App/>
</table>

## Examples

### Archive a customer by name
```bash
replicated customer archive "Acme Inc"
```

### Archive a customer by ID
```bash
replicated customer archive cus_abcdef123456
```

### Archive multiple customers by ID
```bash
replicated customer archive cus_abcdef123456 cus_xyz9876543210
```

### Archive a customer in a specific app (if you have multiple apps)
```bash
replicated customer archive --app myapp "Acme Inc"
```
