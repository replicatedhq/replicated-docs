# Embedded Cluster Install Command Options

This topic describes the options available with the Embedded Cluster install command. For more information about how to install with Embedded Cluster, see [Online Installation with Embedded Cluster](/enterprise/installing-embedded) or [Air Gap Installation with Embedded Cluster](/enterprise/installing-embedded).

## Usage

```bash
sudo ./APP_SLUG install --license PATH_TO_LICENSE [flags]
```
* `APP_SLUG` is the unique application slug
* `PATH_TO_LICENSE` is the path to the customer license

        <p>**Limitations:**</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The data directory for Embedded Cluster cannot be changed after the cluster is installed.</li>
            <li>For multi-node installations, the same data directory that is supplied at installation is used for all nodes joined to the cluster. You cannot choose a different data directory when joining nodes with the Embedded Cluster `join` command. For more information about joining nodes, see [Add Nodes to a Cluster](/enterprise/embedded-manage-nodes#add-nodes) in _Managing Multi-Node Clusters with Embedded Cluster_.</li>
            <li>If you use the `--data-dir` flag to change the data directory during installation, then you must use the same location when restoring in a disaster recovery scenario. For more information about disaster recovery with Embedded Cluster, see [Disaster Recovery for Embedded Cluster](/vendor/embedded-disaster-recovery).</li>
            <li>Replicated does not support using symlinks for the Embedded Cluster data directory. Use the `--data-dir` flag instead of symlinking `/var/lib/embedded-cluster`.</li>

## Examples

### Air Gap Install

```bash
sudo ./my-app install --license license.yaml --airgap-bundle myapp.airgap
```

### Change the Admin Console and LAM Ports

```bash
sudo ./my-app install --license license.yaml --admin-console-port=20000 --local-artifact-mirror-port=40000
```

### Change the Data Directory

```bash
sudo ./my-app install --license license.yaml --data-dir /data/embedded-cluster
```

### Headless (Automated) Install

```bash
sudo ./my-app install --license license.yaml \
  --config-values configvalues.yaml \
  --admin-console-password password
```

### Install Behind a Proxy

```bash
sudo ./APP_SLUG install --license license.yaml \
  --http-proxy=HOST:PORT \
  --https-proxy=HOST:PORT \
  --no-proxy=LIST_OF_HOSTS
```
Where:

* `HOST:PORT` is the host and port of the proxy server
* `LIST_OF_HOSTS` is the list of hosts to not proxy. For example, the IP address of the node where you are installing. Or, for multi-node clusters, the list of IP addresses for all nodes in the cluster, typically in CIDR notation.

### Set Admin Console Password

```bash
sudo ./my-app install --license license.yaml --admin-console-password password
```

### Set IP Address Range for Pods and Services

```bash
sudo ./my-app install --license license.yaml --cidr 172.16.136.0/16
```

### Use a Specific Network Interface

```bash
sudo ./my-app install --license license.yaml --network-interface eno167777
```
