            <li>The data directory for Embedded Cluster cannot be changed after the cluster is installed.</li>
            <li>For multi-node installations, the same data directory that is supplied at installation is used for all nodes joined to the cluster. You cannot choose a different data directory when joining nodes with the Embedded Cluster `join` command. For more information about joining nodes, see [Add Nodes to a Cluster](/enterprise/embedded-manage-nodes#add-nodes) in _Managing Multi-Node Clusters with Embedded Cluster_.</li>
            <li>If you use the `--data-dir` flag to change the data directory during installation, then you must use the same location when restoring in a disaster recovery scenario. For more information about disaster recovery with Embedded Cluster, see [Disaster Recovery for Embedded Cluster](/vendor/embedded-disaster-recovery).</li>
            <li>Replicated does not support using symlinks for the Embedded Cluster data directory. Use the `--data-dir` flag instead of symlinking `/var/lib/embedded-cluster`.</li>

If there are no failed preflights, no user prompt is displayed. Additionally, the Admin Console still runs any application-specific preflight checks before the application is deployed. For more information about the Embedded Cluster host preflight checks, see [About Host Preflight Checks](/vendor/embedded-using#about-host-preflight-checks) in _Using Embedded Cluster_.</p>

For multi-node installations, when deploying the first node, pass the list of IP addresses for all nodes in the cluster (typically in CIDR notation). The network interface's subnet will automatically be added to the no-proxy list if the node's IP address is not already included.</p>
       <p>The following are never proxied:</p>

## Examples

### Air Gap Install

```bash
sudo ./my-app install --license license.yaml --airgap-bundle myapp.airgap
```

### Change the Admin Console and LAM Ports

```bash
sudo ./my-app install --license license.yaml --admin-console-port=20000 --local-artifact-mirror-port=40000
```

### Change the Data Directory

```bash
sudo ./my-app install --license license.yaml --data-dir /data/embedded-cluster
```

### Headless (Automated) Install

```bash
sudo ./my-app install --license license.yaml \
  --config-values configvalues.yaml \
  --admin-console-password password
```

### Install Behind a Proxy

```bash
sudo ./APP_SLUG install --license license.yaml \
  --http-proxy=HOST:PORT \
  --https-proxy=HOST:PORT \
  --no-proxy=LIST_OF_HOSTS
```
Where:

* `HOST:PORT` is the host and port of the proxy server
* `LIST_OF_HOSTS` is the list of hosts to not proxy. For example, the IP address of the node where you are installing. Or, for multi-node clusters, the list of IP addresses for all nodes in the cluster, typically in CIDR notation.

### Set Admin Console Password

```bash
sudo ./my-app install --license license.yaml --admin-console-password password
```

### Set IP Address Range for Pods and Services

```bash
sudo ./my-app install --license license.yaml --cidr 172.16.136.0/16
```

### Use a Specific Network Interface

```bash
sudo ./my-app install --license license.yaml --network-interface eno167777
```
