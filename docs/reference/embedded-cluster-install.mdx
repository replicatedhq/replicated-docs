# Embedded Cluster Install Command Options

This topic describes the options available with the Embedded Cluster install command. For more information about how to install with Embedded Cluster, see [Online Installation with Embedded Cluster](/enterprise/installing-embedded) or [Air Gap Installation with Embedded Cluster](/enterprise/installing-embedded).

## Usage

```bash
sudo ./APP_SLUG install --license LICENSE_FILE [flags]
```
* `APP_SLUG` is the unique application slug
* `LICENSE_FILE` is the customer's license

## Flags

        <p>**Limitation:** It is not possible to change the port for the Admin Console during a restore with Embedded Cluster. For more information, see [Disaster Recovery for Embedded Cluster (Alpha)](/vendor/embedded-disaster-recovery).</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The data directory for Embedded Cluster cannot be changed after the cluster is installed.</li>
            <li>If you use the `--data-dir` flag to change the data directory during installation, then you must use the same location when restoring in a disaster recovery scenario. For more information about disaster recovery with Embedded Cluster, see [Disaster Recovery for Embedded Cluster](/vendor/embedded-disaster-recovery).</li>
            <li>Replicated does not support using symlinks for the Embedded Cluster data directory. Use the `--data-dir` flag instead of symlinking `/var/lib/embedded-cluster`.</li>

For multi-node installations, when deploying the first node, pass the list of IP addresses for all nodes in the cluster (typically in CIDR notation). The network interface's subnet will automatically be added to the no-proxy list if the node's IP address isn't already included.</p>

       </ul>
       <p>To ensure your application's internal cluster communication is not proxied, use fully qualified domain names like `my-service.my-namespace.svc` or `my-service.my-namespace.svc.cluster.local`.</p>

## Examples

### Air Gap Install

```bash
sudo ./myapp install --license license.yaml --airgap-bundle myapp.airgap
```

### Change the Admin Console and LAM Ports

```bash
sudo ./myapp install --admin-console-port=20000 --local-artifact-mirror-port=40000
```

### Change the Data Directory

```bash
sudo ./my-app install --license license.yaml --data-dir /data/embedded-cluster
```

### Install Behind a Proxy

```bash
sudo ./APP_SLUG install --license LICENSE_FILE \
  --http-proxy=HOST:PORT \
  --https-proxy=HOST:PORT \
  --no-proxy=LIST_OF_HOSTS
```
Where:

* `HOST:PORT` is the host and port of the proxy server
* `LIST_OF_HOSTS` is the list of hosts to not proxy. For example, the IP address of the node where you are installing. Or, for multi-node clusters, the list of IP addresses for all nodes in the cluster, typically in CIDR notation.

### Set IP Address Range for Pods and Services

```bash
sudo ./my-app install --license license.yaml --cidr 172.16.136.0/16
```
