# Customizing the Application Icon

You can add a custom application icon that displays in the Replicated Admin Console and the download portal. Adding a custom icon helps ensure that your brand is reflected for your customers.

## Add a Custom Icon

For information about how to choose an image file for your custom application icon that displays well in the Admin Console, see [Icon Image File Recommendations](#icon-image-file-recommendations) below.

To add a custom application icon:

1. In the [Vendor Portal](https://vendor.replicated.com/apps), click **Releases**. Click **Create release** to create a new release, or click **Edit YAML** to edit an existing release.
1. Create or open the Application custom resource manifest file. An Application custom resource manifest file has `apiVersion: kots.io/v1beta1` and `kind: Application`.

1. In the preview section of the Help pane:

    1. If your Application manifest file is already populated with an `icon` key, the icon displays in the preview. Click **Preview a different icon** to access the preview options.

    1. Drag and drop an icon image file to the drop zone. Alternatively, paste a link or Base64 encoded data URL in the text box. Click **Preview**.

       ![Application icon preview](/images/app-icon-preview.png)

    1. (Air gap only) If you paste a link to the image in the text box, click **Preview** and **Base64 encode icon** to convert the image to a Base64 encoded data URL. An encoded URL displays that you can copy and paste into the Application manifest. Base64 encoding is required for images used with air gap installations.

        :::note
        If you pasted a Base64 encoded data URL into the text box, the **Base64 encode icon** button does not display because the image is already encoded. If you drag and drop an icon, the icon is automatically encoded for you.

        ![Base64 encode image button](/images/app-icon-preview-base64.png)

    1. Click **Preview a different icon** to preview a different icon if needed.

1. In the Application manifest, under `spec`, add an `icon` key that includes a link or the Base64 encoded data URL to the desired image.

   **Example**:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: kots.io/v1beta1
   kind: Application
   metadata:
     name: my-application
   spec:
     title: My Application
     icon: https://kots.io/images/kotsadm-logo-large@2x.png
   ```
1. Click **Save Release**.


## Icon Image File Recommendations

For your custom application icon to look best in the Admin Console, consider the following recommendations:

* Use a PNG or JPG file.
* Use an image that is at least 250 by 250 pixels.
* Export the image file at 2x.
