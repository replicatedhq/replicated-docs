# replicated api get

Make ad-hoc GET API calls to the Replicated API

### Synopsis

This is essentially like curl for the Replicated API, but
uses your local credentials and prints the response unmodified.

We recommend piping the output to jq for easier reading.

Pass the PATH of the request as the final argument. Do not include the host or version.

```
replicated api get [flags]
```
