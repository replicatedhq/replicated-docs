# About Custom Resources

You can include custom resources in releases to control the experience for applications installed with Replicated KOTS.

Custom resources are consumed by KOTS, the Admin Console, or by other kubectl plugins. Custom resources are packaged as part of the application, but are _not_ deployed to the cluster.

## KOTS Custom Resources

The following are custom resources in the `kots.io` API group:

| API Group/Version | Kind | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| kots.io/v1beta1 | [Application](custom-resource-application) | Adds additional metadata (branding, release notes and more) to an application |
| kots.io/v1beta1 | [Config](custom-resource-config)| Defines a user-facing configuration screen in the Admin Console |
| kots.io/v1beta2 | [HelmChart](custom-resource-helmchart-v2) | Identifies an instantiation of a Helm Chart |
| kots.io/v1beta1 | [LintConfig](custom-resource-lintconfig) | Customizes the default rule levels for the KOTS release linter |
