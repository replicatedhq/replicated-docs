# About Custom Resources

An application can include several recommended, but optional, custom resources.
These custom resources are packaged as part of the application, but are not deployed to the cluster.
The custom resources defined here are included to control the application experience. They are consumed by the Replicated app manager, the Replicated admin console, or by other kubectl plugins.
