# ConfigValues

This topic describes the Replicated KOTS ConfigValues custom resource. ConfigValues is used to provide application configuration values during automated or headless installations with the CLI.

## Overview

The ConfigValues custom resource lists the user-supplied and default values for each application configuration item defined in the Replicated KOTS Config custom resource in the release. For more information about the Config custom resource, see [Config](custom-resource-config).

For each installation, the Admin Console automatically generates a ConfigValues resource and makes it available for download in the **View files** tab. End users can also manually create a ConfigValues resource. For example, users must pass a ConfigValues resource during automated or headless installs from the command line to provide application configuration values to the Admin Console. For more information about performing headless installations, see [Automate Embedded Cluster Installations](/enterprise/installing-embedded-automation) and [Automate Existing Cluster Installations with the KOTS CLI](/enterprise/installing-existing-cluster-automation).

The following image shows how a ConfigValues resource is generated based on the items defined in a Config resource:

As shown in the image above, the ConfigValues resource `values` key lists each item from the Config resource by its `name`. For each item, the ConfigValues lists the `default` value defined in the Config resource (if applicable) as well as the user-supplied `value`.

## Examples



## Spec

### values.[item_name].default

The `default` value that was defined for the item in the Config custom resource in the release.

When creating a ConfigValues to perform a headless installation from the command line, the `default` value must match the default that was defined in the Config custom resource.

### values.[item_name].value

The value for the item. This is either a user-supplied value or a value rendered by a Replicated template function used in the Config custom resource.

For user-supplied values, the value must meet the following requirements:
* The value must For example, if the item includes a `validation` field with regex, then the value supplied must match the regex pattern.
* For `select_one` items, the value must match the name of one of the options defined in the Config custom resource
* All required config items must have a default or a value supplied

### values.[item_name].valuePlainText

When creating a ConfigValues to provide during a headless install from the command line, users must include the `valuePlainText` field to provide values for `password` config items.

The following shows an example of how a `valuesPlainText` field in a user-supplied ConfigValues is rendered in a post-installation ConfigValues generated by the Admin Console:
