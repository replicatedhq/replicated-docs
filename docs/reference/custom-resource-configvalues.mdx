# ConfigValues

This topic describes the Replicated KOTS ConfigValues custom resource. ConfigValues is used to provide application configuration values during automated or headless installations with the CLI.

## Overview

The ConfigValues resource lists the values and defaults set for each application configuration item defined in the Replicated KOTS Config custom resource in the release. For more information about the Config custom resource, see [Config](custom-resource-config).

For each installation, the Admin Console automatically generates a ConfigValues resource and makes it available for download in the **View files** tab.

In automated or headless installs from the command line, end users must pass a ConfigValues resource to the install command to provide application configuration values to the Admin Console. For more information about performing headless installations, see [Automate Embedded Cluster Installations](/enterprise/installing-embedded-automation) and [Automate Existing Cluster Installations with the KOTS CLI](/enterprise/installing-existing-cluster-automation).

The following image shows how application configuration items defined a Config resource are represented in a ConfigValues resource:

As shown in the image above, the ConfigValues resource `values` key lists each item from the Config resource by its `name`. For each item, the ConfigValues resource lists the user-supplied value as well as the default that was defined in the Config resource (if applicable).

## Example

The following shows an example of a ConfigValues resource that can be provided during automated or headless installation from the command line:

<ConfigValuesExample/>

## Spec

### values.[item_name].default

The `default` value that was defined for the item in the Config custom resource in the release.

When creating a ConfigValues to perform a headless installation from the command line, the `default` value must match the default that was defined in the Config custom resource.

### values.[item_name].value

The value for the item. This is either a user-supplied value or a value rendered by a Replicated template function used in the Config custom resource.

For user-supplied values, the value must meet the following requirements:
* The value must For example, if the item includes a `validation` field with regex, then the value supplied must match the regex pattern.
* For `select_one` items, the value must match the name of one of the options defined in the Config custom resource
* All required config items must have a default or a value supplied

### values.[item_name].valuePlainText

When creating a ConfigValues to provide during a headless install from the command line, users must include the `valuePlainText` field to provide values for `password` config items.

The following shows an example of how a `valuesPlainText` field in a user-supplied ConfigValues is rendered in a post-installation ConfigValues generated by the Admin Console:
