# replicated cluster port rm

Remove cluster port by ID.

### Synopsis

The 'cluster port rm' command removes a specific port from a cluster. You must provide the ID or name of the cluster and either the ID of the port or the port number and protocol(s) to remove.

This command is useful for managing the network settings of your test clusters by allowing you to clean up unused or incorrect ports. After removing a port, the updated list of ports will be displayed.

Note that you can only use either the port ID or port number when removing a port, not both at the same time.

```
replicated cluster port rm CLUSTER_ID_OR_NAME --id PORT_ID [flags]
