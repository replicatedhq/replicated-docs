# Step 3: Add the Chart Archive to a Release

Use the Replicated CLI to add the Gitea Helm chart archive to a release in the Replicated vendor platform.

To create a release:

1. Install the Replicated CLI:

   ```
   brew install replicatedhq/replicated/cli
   ```
   For more installation options, see [Installing the Replicated CLI](/reference/replicated-cli-installing).

1. Authorize the Replicated CLI:

   ```
   replicated login
   ```
   In the browser window that opens, complete the prompts to log in to your vendor account and authorize the CLI.

1. Create an application named `Gitea`:

   ```
   replicated app create Gitea
   ```

1. Get the slug for the application that you created:

   ```
   replicated app ls
   ```
   **Example output**:
   ```
   ID                             NAME            SLUG            SCHEDULER
   2WthxUIfGT13RlrsUx9HR7So8bR    Gitea           gitea-boxer     kots
   ```
   In the example above, the application slug is `gitea-boxer`.

1. Set the `REPLICATED_APP` environment variable to the application that you created. This allows you to interact with the application using the Replicated CLI without needing to use the `--app` flag with every command:

   **Example:**

   ```
   export REPLICATED_APP=gitea-boxer
   ```

1. Go to the `gitea` directory.

1. Create a release with the Gitea chart archive:

   ```
   replicated release create --chart=gitea-1.0.6.tgz
   ```
   ```bash
   You are creating a release that will only be installable with the helm CLI.

   ```

1. Log in to the Vendor Portal and go to **Releases**.

    The release that you created is listed under **All releases**.

1. Click **View YAML** to view the files in the release.

1. At the top of the page, click **Promote**.

   <img alt="Promote release dialog" src="/images/release-promote.png" width="400px"/>

1. In the dialog, for **Which channels you would like to promote this release to?**, select **Unstable**. Unstable is a default channel that is intended for use with internal testing.

1. For **Version label**, open the dropdown and select **1.0.6**.

1. Click **Promote**.


## Next Step

Create a customer so that you can install the release in a development environment. See [Create a Customer](tutorial-preflight-helm-create-customer).
