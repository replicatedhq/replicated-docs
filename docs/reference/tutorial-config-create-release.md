# Step 4: Add the Chart Archive to a Release

Next, add the Helm chart archive to a new release for the application in the Replicated vendor platform.

The purpose of this step is to configure a release that supports installation with KOTS. Additionally, this step defines a user-facing application configuration page that displays in the KOTS Admin Console during installation where users can set their own Grafana login credentials.

To create a release:

1. In the `grafana` directory, create a subdirectory named `manifests`:

   ```
   mkdir manifests
   ```

   You will add the files required to support installation with Replicated KOTS to this subdirectory.

1. Move the Helm chart archive that you created to `manifests`:

   ```
   mv grafana-9.6.5.tgz manifests
   ```

1. In the `manifests` directory, create the following YAML files to configure the release:
   
     ```
     cd manifests
     ```
     ```
     touch kots-app.yaml k8s-app.yaml kots-config.yaml grafana.yaml
     ```

1. In each file, paste the corresponding YAML provided in the tabs below:

     <Tabs>
      <TabItem value="kots-app" label="kots-app.yaml" default>
      <h5>Description</h5>
      <p>The KOTS Application custom resource enables features in the Admin Console such as branding, release notes, port forwarding, dashboard buttons, application status indicators, and custom graphs.</p><p>The YAML below provides a name for the application to display in the Admin Console, adds a custom <em>status informer</em> that displays the status of the <code>grafana</code> Deployment resource in the Admin Console dashboard, adds a custom application icon, and creates a port forward so that the user can open the Grafana application in a browser.</p>
      <h5>YAML</h5>
      <KotsApp/>
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem value="k8s-app" label="k8s-app.yaml">
      <h5>Description</h5>
      <p>The Kubernetes Application custom resource supports functionality such as including buttons and links on the Admin Console dashboard. The YAML below adds an <strong>Open App</strong> button to the Admin Console dashboard that opens the application using the port forward configured in the KOTS Application custom resource.</p>
      <h5>YAML</h5>
      <K8sApp/>
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem value="config" label="kots-config.yaml">
      <h5>Description</h5>
      <p>The Config custom resource specifies a user-facing configuration page in the Admin Console designed for collecting application configuration from users. The YAML below creates "Admin User" and "Admin Password" fields that will be shown to the user on the configuration page during installation. These fields will be used to set the login credentials for Grafana.</p>
      <h5>YAML</h5>
      <Config/>
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem value="helmchart" label="grafana.yaml">
      <h5>Description</h5>
      <p>The KOTS HelmChart custom resource provides instructions to KOTS about how to deploy the Helm chart.</p>
      <p>The HelmChart custom resource below contains a <code>values</code> key, which creates a mapping to the Grafana <code>values.yaml</code> file. In this case, the <code>values.admin.user</code> and <code>values.admin.password</code> fields map to <code>admin.user</code> and <code>admin.password</code> in the Grafana <code>values.yaml</code> file.</p>
      <p>During installation, KOTS renders the ConfigOption template functions in the <code>values.admin.user</code> and <code>values.admin.password</code> fields and then sets the corresponding Grafana values accordingly.</p>
      <h5>YAML</h5>
      <HelmChart/>
      </TabItem>
      </Tabs>

1. From the `manifests` directory, lint the YAML files to confirm that there are no errors:

     ```
     replicated release lint --yaml-dir .
     ```
     `--yaml-dir` is the path to the directory that contains the Helm chart archive and the manifest files required by KOTS.

     **Example output**:

     ```
     RULE                               TYPE    FILENAME        LINE  MESSAGE                                                     
     preflight-spec                     warn                          Missing preflight spec
     troubleshoot-spec                  warn                          Missing troubleshoot spec
     nonexistent-status-informer-object warn    kots-app.yaml   8     Status informer points to a nonexistent kubernetes object. If this is a Helm resource, this warning can be ignored.
     ```
     :::note
     The output includes warning messages that list missing manifest files. These manifests control additional KOTS functionality and can be ignored for the purpose of this tutorial. The `nonexistent-status-informer-object` warning can also be ignored because the `grafana` Deployment resource that was added as a status informer in the KOTS Application custom resource is a Helm resource.
     :::

1. Create a release:

   ```
   replicated release create --yaml-dir .
   ```
   **Example output**:
   ```
   • Reading manifests from . ✓
   • Creating Release ✓
     • SEQUENCE: 1
   ```

1. Log in to the Vendor Portal and go to **Releases**.

    The release that you created is listed under **All releases**.

1. Click **Edit release** to view the files in the release.

    In the release editor, you can see the manifest files that you created, the Helm chart `.tgz` archive, and the `Chart.yaml` and `values.yaml` files for the Grafana Helm chart. You can also see the same warning messages that were displayed in the CLI output.

1. At the top of the page, click **Promote**.

1. In the dialog, for **Which channels you would like to promote this release to?**, select **Unstable**. Unstable is a default channel that is intended for use with internal testing. Click **Promote**.

## Next Step

Create a customer with the KOTS entitlement so that you can install the release in your cluster using Replicated KOTS. See [Step 5: Create a KOTS-Enabled Customer](tutorial-config-create-customer).
