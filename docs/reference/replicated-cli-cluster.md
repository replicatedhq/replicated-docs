# Create a single-node EKS cluster
replicated cluster create --distribution eks --version 1.31

# List all clusters
replicated cluster ls

# Remove a specific cluster by ID
replicated cluster rm <cluster-id>

# List all nodegroups in a specific cluster
replicated cluster nodegroup ls <cluster-id>
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for cluster
```
