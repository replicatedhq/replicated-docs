# replicated vm ssh

SSH into a VM

### Synopsis

Connect to a VM using SSH.

If a VM ID is provided, it will directly connect to that VM. Otherwise, if multiple VMs are available, you will be prompted to select the VM you want to connect to. The command will then establish an SSH connection to the selected VM using the appropriate credentials and configuration.

The SSH user can be specified in order of precedence:
1. By specifying the -u flag
2. REPLICATED_SSH_USER environment variable
3. GITHUB_ACTOR environment variable (from GitHub Actions)
4. GITHUB_USER environment variable

Note: Only running VMs can be connected to via SSH.

```
replicated vm ssh [VM_ID] [flags]
```

### Examples

# SSH into a specific VM by ID

# SSH into a VM with a specific user

# SSH into a VM (interactive selection if multiple VMs exist)
