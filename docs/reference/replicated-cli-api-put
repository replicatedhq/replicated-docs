# replicated api put

Make ad-hoc PUT API calls to the Replicated API

### Synopsis

This is essentially like curl for the Replicated API, but
uses your local credentials and prints the response unmodified.

We recommend piping the output to jq for easier reading.

Pass the PATH of the request as the final argument. Do not include the host or version.

```
replicated api put [flags]
```

### Examples

```
replicated api put /v3/app/2EuFxKLDxKjPNk2jxMTmF6Vxvxu/channel/2QLPm10JPkta7jO3Z3Mk4aXTPyZ -b '{"name":"marc-waz-here2"}'
```

### Options

```
  -b, --body string   JSON body to send with the request
  -h, --help          help for put
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

      --app string                The app slug or app id to use in all calls
