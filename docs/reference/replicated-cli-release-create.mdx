# replicated release create

Create a new release

### Synopsis

Create a new release by providing application manifests for the next release in
  your sequence.

  If no flags are provided, the command will automatically use the configuration from
  .replicated file in the current directory (or parent directories). The config should
  specify charts and manifests to include. Charts will be automatically packaged using
  helm, and manifests will be collected using glob patterns.

  Example .replicated config:
    appSlug: "my-app"
    charts:
      - path: ./chart
    manifests:
      - ./manifests/*.yaml

  With this config, simply run:
    replicated release create --version 1.0.0 --promote Unstable

  To mark a release as required during upgrades:
    replicated release create --version 1.0.0 --promote Unstable --required

```
replicated release create [flags]
```
