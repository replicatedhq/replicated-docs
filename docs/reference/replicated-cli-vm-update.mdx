# replicated vm update

Update VM settings.

### Synopsis

The 'vm update' command allows you to modify the settings of a virtual machine. You can update a VM either by providing its ID or name directly as an argument to subcommands, or by using the '--id' or '--name' flags. This command supports updating various VM settings, which will be handled by specific subcommands.

- To update the VM by its ID or name, use the subcommand directly with the ID or name as an argument.
- Alternatively, to update the VM by its ID, use the '--id' flag.
- Alternatively, to update the VM by its name, use the '--name' flag.

Subcommands will allow for more specific updates like TTL

# Update a VM TTL by specifying its ID or name directly
