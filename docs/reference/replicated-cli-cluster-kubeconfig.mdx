# replicated cluster kubeconfig

Download credentials for a test cluster.

### Synopsis

The 'cluster kubeconfig' command downloads the credentials (kubeconfig) required to access a test cluster. You can either merge these credentials into your existing kubeconfig file or save them as a new file.

This command ensures that the kubeconfig is correctly configured for use with your Kubernetes tools. You can specify the cluster by ID or name directly as an argument, or by using the '--id' or '--name' flags. Additionally, the kubeconfig can be written to a specific file path or printed to stdout.

You can also use this command to automatically update your current Kubernetes context with the downloaded credentials.

```
replicated cluster kubeconfig [ID_OR_NAME] [flags]
```

### Examples

```
# Download and merge kubeconfig into your existing configuration
replicated cluster kubeconfig CLUSTER_ID_OR_NAME

# Save the kubeconfig to a specific file
replicated cluster kubeconfig CLUSTER_ID_OR_NAME --output-path ./kubeconfig

# Print the kubeconfig to stdout
replicated cluster kubeconfig CLUSTER_ID_OR_NAME --stdout

# Download kubeconfig for a cluster by name using a flag
replicated cluster kubeconfig --name "My Cluster"

# Download kubeconfig for a cluster by ID using a flag
replicated cluster kubeconfig --id CLUSTER_ID
```
