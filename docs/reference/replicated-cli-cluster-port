# replicated cluster port

Manage cluster ports.

### Synopsis

The 'cluster port' command is a parent command for managing ports in a cluster. It allows users to list, remove, or expose specific ports used by the cluster. Use the subcommands (such as 'ls', 'rm', and 'expose') to manage port configurations effectively.

This command provides flexibility for handling ports in various test clusters, ensuring efficient management of cluster networking settings.

### Examples

```
# List all exposed ports in a cluster
replicated cluster port ls [CLUSTER_ID]

# Remove an exposed port from a cluster
replicated cluster port rm [CLUSTER_ID] [PORT]

# Expose a new port in a cluster
replicated cluster port expose [CLUSTER_ID] [PORT]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for port
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --app string                The app slug or app id to use in all calls
      --integration-test string   Set to the name of the integration test to run
      --log-api-calls string      Log the API calls to the specified file
      --token string              The API token to use to access your app in the Vendor API
```
