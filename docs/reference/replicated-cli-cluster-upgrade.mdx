# replicated cluster upgrade

Upgrade a test cluster.

### Synopsis

The 'upgrade' command upgrades a Kubernetes test cluster to a specified version. You must provide a cluster ID or name and the version to upgrade to. The upgrade can be simulated with a dry-run option, or you can choose to wait for the cluster to be fully upgraded.
