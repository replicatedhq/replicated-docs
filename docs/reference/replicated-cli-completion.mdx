# replicated completion

Generate completion script

```
replicated completion [bash|zsh|fish|powershell]
```

### Examples

```
To load completions:

Bash:

	This script depends on the 'bash-completion' package.
	If it is not installed already, you can install it via your OS's package manager.

	$ source <(replicated completion bash)

	# To load completions for each session, execute once:
	# Linux:
	$ replicated completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/replicated
	# macOS:
	$ replicated completion bash > $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion.d/replicated

Zsh:

	# If shell completion is not already enabled in your environment,
	# you will need to enable it.  You can execute the following once:

	$ echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc

	# To load completions for each session, execute once:
	$ replicated completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_replicated"

	# You will need to start a new shell for this setup to take effect.

fish:

	$ replicated completion fish | source

	# To load completions for each session, execute once:
	$ replicated completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/replicated.fish

PowerShell:

	PS> replicated completion powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression

	# To load completions for every new session, run:
	PS> replicated completion powershell > replicated.ps1
	# and source this file from your PowerShell profile.
