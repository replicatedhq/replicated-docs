# Redactor

Preflight checks and support bundles include built-in redactors that hide sensitive customer data before it is analyzed. These default redactors hide passwords, tokens, AWS secrets, IP addresses, database connection strings, and URLs that contain usernames and passwords.

The default redactors cannot be disabled, but you can add custom redactors to support bundles using the Redactor custom resource manifest file. For example, you can redact API keys or account numbers, depending on your customer needs. For more information about redactors, see [Redacting Data](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/redact/) in the Troubleshoot documentation.

## Basic Manifest File

You can add custom redactors to the following basic Redactor custom resource manifest file (`kind: Redactor`):

```yaml
apiVersion: troubleshoot.sh/v1beta2
kind: Redactor
metadata:
  name: sample
spec:
  redactors: []
```

## Objects and Fields

A redactor supports two objects: `fileSelector` and `removals`. Each object is supported by fields that specify what is redacted and how the redactions should occur. For more information and examples of these fields, see [Example Redactors](#example-redactors) below and [Redactors](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/redact/redactors/) in the Troubleshoot documentation.

### fileSelector

The `fileSelector` object determines which files the redactor is applied to. If this object is omitted from the manifest file, the redactor is applied to all files. This object supports the following optional fields:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th width="30%">Field Name</th>
    <th width="70%">Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>file</code></td>
    <td>(Optional) Specifies a single file for redaction.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>files</code></td>
    <td>(Optional) Specifies multiple files for redaction.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Globbing is used to match files. For example, <code>/my/test/glob/*</code> matches <code>/my/test/glob/file</code>, but does not match <code>/my/test/glob/subdir/file</code>.

### removals

The `removals` object is required and defines the redactions that occur. This object supports the following fields. At least one of these fields must be specified:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th width="30%">Field Name</th>
    <th width="70%">Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>regex</code></td>
    <td>(Optional) Allows a regular expression to be applied for removal and redaction on lines that immediately follow a line that matches a filter. The <code>selector</code> field is used to identify lines, and the <code>redactor</code> field specifies a regular expression that runs on the line after any line identified by <code>selector</code>. If <code>selector</code> is empty, the redactor runs on every line. Using a <code>selector</code> is useful for removing values from pretty-printed JSON, where the value to be redacted is pretty-printed on the line beneath another value.<br></br><br></br>Matches to the regex are removed or redacted, depending on the construction of the regex. Any portion of a match not contained within a capturing group is removed entirely. The contents of capturing groups tagged <code>mask</code> are masked with <code>***HIDDEN***</code>. Capturing groups tagged <code>drop</code> are dropped.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>values</code></td>
    <td>(Optional) Specifies values to replace with the string <code>***HIDDEN***</code>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>yamlPath</code></td>
    <td>(Optional) Specifies a <code>.</code>-delimited path to the items to be redacted from a YAML document. If an item in the path is the literal string <code>*</code>, the redactor is applied to all options at that level.<br></br><br></br>Files that fail to parse as YAML or do not contain any matches are not modified. Files that do contain matches are re-rendered, which removes comments and custom formatting. Multi-document YAML is not fully supported. Only the first document is checked for matches, and if a match is found, later documents are discarded entirely.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Example Redactors

The following example shows `values`, `regex`, and `yamlPath` redaction for a support bundle:

```yaml
apiVersion: troubleshoot.sh/v1beta2
kind: Redactor
metadata:
  name: my-redactor-name
spec:
  redactors:
  - name: replace password # names are not used internally, but are useful for recordkeeping
    fileSelector:
      file: data/my-password-dump # this targets a single file
    removals:
      values:
      - abc123 # this value is my password, and should never appear in a support bundle
  - name: all files # as no file is specified, this redactor will run against all files
    removals:
      regex:
      - redactor: (another)(?P<mask>.*)(here) # this will replace anything between the strings `another` and `here` with `***HIDDEN***`
      - selector: 'S3_ENDPOINT' # remove the value in lines immediately following those that contain the string `S3_ENDPOINT`
        redactor: '("value": ").*(")'
      yamlPath:
      - "abc.xyz.*" # redact all items in the array at key `xyz` within key `abc` in YAML documents
```
