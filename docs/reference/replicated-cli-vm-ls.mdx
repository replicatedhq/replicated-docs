# replicated vm ls

List test VMs and their status, with optional filters for start/end time and terminated VMs.

### Synopsis

List all test VMs in your account, including their current status, distribution, version, and more. You can use optional flags to filter the output based on VM termination status, start time, or end time. This command can also watch the VM status in real-time.

By default, the command will return a table of all VMs, but you can switch to JSON or wide output formats for more detailed information. The command supports filtering to show only terminated VMs or to specify a time range for the query.

You can use the '--watch' flag to monitor VMs continuously. This will refresh the list of VMs every 2 seconds, displaying any updates in real-time, such as new VMs being created or existing VMs being terminated.

The command also allows you to customize the output format, supporting 'json', 'table', and 'wide' views for flexibility based on your needs.

VMs are currently a beta feature.
