# Export Customer and Instance Data

This topic describes how to download and export customer and instance data from the Replicated Vendor Portal.

## Overview

While you can always consume customer and instance insight data directly in the Replicated Vendor Portal, the data is also available in a CSV format so that it can be imported into any other system, such as:
* Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems like Salesforce or Gainsight
* Data warehouses like Redshift, Snowflake, or BigQuery
* Business intelligence (BI) tools like Looker, Tableau, or PowerBI

By collecting and organizing this data wherever it is most visible and valuable, you can enable your team to make better decisions about where to focus efforts across product, sales, engineering, and customer success.

## Bulk Export Instance Event Timeseries Data

You can use the Vendor API v3 `/app/{app_id}/events` endpoint to programatically access historical timeseries data containing instance level events, including any custom metrics that you have defined. For more information about the endpoint, see [Get instance events in either JSON or CSV format](https://replicated-vendor-api.readme.io/reference/listappinstanceevents) in the Vendor API v3 documentation.

The `/app/{app_id}/events` endpoint returns data scoped to a given application identifier. It also allows filtering based on time periods, instances identifiers, customers identifers, and event types. You must provide at least **one** query parameter to scope the query in order to receive a response. 

By bulk exporting this instance event data with the `/app/{app_id}/events` endpoint, you can:
* Identify trends and potential problem areas 
* Demonstrate the impact, adoption, and usage of recent product features

### Filter Bulk Data Exports

You can use the following types of filters to filter timeseries data for bulk export:

- **Filter by date**:
    - Get instance events recorded _at or before_ the query date. For example:
        ```bash
        curl -H "Authorization: $REPLICATED_API_TOKEN" \ 
        "https://api.replicated.com/vendor/v3/app/:appID/events?before=2023-10-15"
        ```
    - Get instance events recorded _at or after_ the query date. For example:
        ```shell
        curl -H "Authorization: $REPLICATED_API_TOKEN" \ 
        "https://api.replicated.com/vendor/v3/app/:appID/events?after=2023-10-15"
        ```
    - Get instance events recorded within a range of dates [after, before]. For example:
        ```shell
        curl -H "Authorization: $REPLICATED_API_TOKEN" \ 
        "https://api.replicated.com/vendor/v3/app/:appID/events?after=2023-05-02&before=2023-10-15"
        ```
- **Filter by customer**: Get instance events from one or more customers using a comma-separated list of customer IDs. For example:
    ```bash
    curl -H "Authorization: $REPLICATED_API_TOKEN" \ 
    "https://api.replicated.com/vendor/v3/app/:appID/events?customerIDs=1b13241,2Rjk2923481"
    ```
- **Filter by event type**: Get instance events by event type using a comma-separated list of event types. For example:
    ```bash
    curl -H "Authorization: $REPLICATED_API_TOKEN" \ 
    "https://api.replicated.com/vendor/v3/app/:appID/events?eventTypes=numUsers,numProjects"
    ```

:::note
If any filter is passed for an object that does not exist, no warning is given. For example, if a `customerIDs` filter is passed for an ID that does not exist, or for an ID that the user does not have access to, then an empty array is returned.
