# Install the Replicated CLI

This topic describes how to install and run the Replicated CLI.

You can use the Replicated CLI to manage your applications with Replicated programmatically, rather than using the Replicated Vendor Portal.

## Prerequisites

Complete the following prerequisites before installing the Replicated CLI:

- Create a vendor account. See [Create a Vendor Account](/vendor/vendor-portal-creating-account).
- To run on Linux or Mac, install [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/).
- To run through a Docker container, install [docker](https://www.docker.com).

## Install and Run

You can install and run the Replicated CLI in the following environments: 

* Directly on MacOS
* Directly on Linux
* Through Docker (Useful for Windows, GitHub Actions, or computers without sufficient access)

### MacOS

To install and run the latest Replicated CLI on MacOS:

1. <InstallMac/>

      <Sudo/>

1. <Verify/>

1. <Login/>

   <AuthToken/>

1. <Logout/>

### Linux / Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) {#linux-wsl2}

To install and run the latest Replicated CLI on Linux or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL):

1. For Windows users, first install Linux on Windows using WSL2. See [How to install Linux on Windows with WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

1. <InstallLinux/>

    <Sudo/>

1. <Verify/>

1. <Login/>

   <AuthToken/>

1. <Logout/>

### Docker / Windows

<InstallDocker/> 

## (Optional) Set Environment Variables {#env-var}

The Replicated CLI supports setting the following environment variables:

* **`REPLICATED_API_TOKEN`**: A service account or user API token generated from a vendor portal team or individual account. The `REPLICATED_API_TOKEN` environment variable has the following use cases:

  * To use Replicated CLI commands as part of automation (such as from continuous integration and continuous delivery pipelines), authenticate by providing the `REPLICATED_API_TOKEN` environment variable.

  * To authorize the Replicated CLI when installing and running the CLI in Docker containers.
  
  * Optionally set the `REPLICATED_API_TOKEN` environment variable instead of using the `replicated login` command to authorize the Replicated CLI in MacOS or Linux environments.

* **`REPLICATED_APP`**: The slug of the target application.

  When using the Replicated CLI to manage applications through your vendor account (including channels, releases, customers, or other objects associated with an application), you can set the `REPLICATED_APP` environment variable to avoid passing the application slug with each command.

### `REPLICATED_API_TOKEN`

To set the `REPLICATED_API_TOKEN` environment variable:

1. Generate a service account or user API token in the vendor portal. To create new releases, the token must have `Read/Write` access. See [Generating API Tokens](/vendor/replicated-api-tokens).

1. Set the environment variable, replacing `TOKEN` with the token you generated in the previous step:

    * **MacOs or Linux**:

      ```
      export REPLICATED_API_TOKEN=TOKEN
      ```

    * **Docker**:

      ```
      docker run \
       -e REPLICATED_API_TOKEN=$TOKEN \
       replicated/vendor-cli --help
      ```

    * **Windows**:

      ```
      docker.exe run \
        -e REPLICATED_API_TOKEN=%TOKEN% \
        replicated/vendor-cli --help
      ```

### `REPLICATED_APP`

To set the `REPLICATED_APP` environment variable:

1. In the [vendor portal](https://vendor.replicated.com), go to the **Application Settings** page and copy the slug for the target application. For more information, see [Get the Application Slug](/vendor/vendor-portal-manage-app#slug) in _Managing Application_.

1. Set the environment variable, replacing `APP_SLUG` with the slug for the target application that you retreived in the previous step:

    * **MacOs or Linux**:

      ```
      export REPLICATED_APP=APP_SLUG
      ```

    * **Docker**:

      ```
      docker run \
         -e REPLICATED_APP=$APP_SLUG
         replicated/vendor-cli --help
      ```

    * **Windows**:

      ```
      docker.exe run \
        -e REPLICATED_APP=%APP_SLUG% \
        replicated/vendor-cli --help
      ```
