# customer inspect

The inspect command provides comprehensive details about a customer.

This command retrieves and displays full information about a specified customer,
including their assigned channels, registry information, and other relevant attributes.
It's useful for getting an in-depth view of a customer's configuration and status.

You must specify the customer using either their name or ID with the `--customer` flag.

## Usage
```bash
replicated customer inspect --customer [CUSTOMER_NAME_OR_ID]
```

<table>
  <tr>
    <th width="30%">Flag</th>
    <th width="20%">Type (if applicable)</th>
    <th width="50%">Description</th>
  </tr>
  <App/>
  <tr>
    <td>--customer</td>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>Customer name or ID</td>
  </tr>
  <Help/>
  <tr>
    <td>--output</td>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>The output format to use: `json` or `table`. **Default:** `table`</td>
  </tr>
</table>
