# replicated cluster port expose

Expose a port on a cluster to the public internet.

### Synopsis

The 'cluster port expose' command is used to expose a specified port on a cluster to the public internet. When exposing a port, the command automatically creates a DNS entry and, if using the "https" protocol, provisions a TLS certificate for secure communication.

You can also create a wildcard DNS entry and TLS certificate by specifying the "--wildcard" flag. Please note that creating a wildcard certificate may take additional time.

This command supports different protocols including "http", "https", "ws", and "wss" for web traffic and web socket communication.

NOTE: Currently, this feature only supports VM-based cluster distributions.

```
replicated cluster port expose CLUSTER_ID_OR_NAME --port PORT [flags]
```

### Examples

```
# Expose port for Embedded Cluster (Port: 30000) with HTTP Protocol
replicated cluster port expose CLUSTER_ID_OR_NAME --port 30000 --protocol http

# Expose port 8080 with HTTPS protocol and wildcard DNS
replicated cluster port expose CLUSTER_ID_OR_NAME --port 8080 --protocol https --wildcard

# Expose port 8080 with multiple protocols
replicated cluster port expose CLUSTER_ID_OR_NAME --port 8080 --protocol http,https

# Expose port 8080 and display the result in JSON format
replicated cluster port expose CLUSTER_ID_OR_NAME --port 8080 --protocol https --output json
```
