# Installer History

<KurlAvailability/>

This topic describes how to access the installation commands for all active and inactive kURL installers promoted to a channel. 

## About Using Inactive Installers

Each release channel in the Replicated Vendor Portal saves the history of kURL installers that were promoted to the channel. You can view the list of historical installers on the **kURL Installer History** page for each channel. For more information, see [About the Installer History Page](#about) below.

It can be useful to access the installation commands for inactive installers to reproduce an issue that a user is experiencing for troubleshooting purposes. For example, if the user's cluster is running the inactive installer version 1.0.0, then you can install with version 1.0.0 in a test environment to troubleshoot.

You can also send the installation commands for inactive installers to your users as needed. For example, a user might have unique requirements for specific versions of Kubernetes or add-ons.

## About the Installer History Page {#about}
