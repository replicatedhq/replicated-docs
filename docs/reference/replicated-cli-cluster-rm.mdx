# replicated cluster rm

Remove test clusters.

### Synopsis

The 'rm' command removes test clusters immediately.

You can remove clusters by specifying a cluster ID, or by using other criteria such as cluster names or tags. Alternatively, you can remove all clusters in your account at once.

This command can also be used in a dry-run mode to simulate the removal without actually deleting anything.

You cannot mix the use of cluster IDs with other options like removing by name, tag, or removing all clusters at once.

```
replicated cluster rm ID [ID â€¦] [flags]
```
