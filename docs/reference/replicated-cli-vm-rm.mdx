# replicated vm rm

Remove test VM(s) immediately, with options to filter by name, tag, or remove all VMs.

### Synopsis

The 'rm' command allows you to remove test VMs from your account immediately. You can specify one or more VM IDs or names directly, or use flags to filter which VMs to remove based on their tags, or simply remove all VMs at once.

This command supports multiple filtering options, including removing VMs by their name or ID, by specific tags, or by specifying the '--all' flag to remove all VMs in your account.

When specifying a name that matches multiple VMs, all VMs with that name will be removed.

You can also use the '--dry-run' flag to simulate the removal without actually deleting the VMs.

```
replicated vm rm ID_OR_NAME [ID_OR_NAME â€¦] [flags]
```
