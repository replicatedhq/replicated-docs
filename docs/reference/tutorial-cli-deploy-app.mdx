# Step 7: Configure the Application

After you install KOTS, you can log in to the KOTS Admin Console. This procedure shows you how to make a configuration change for the application from the Admin Console, which is a typical task performed by end users.

To configure the application:

1. Access the Admin Console using `https://localhost:8800` if the installation script is still running. Otherwise, run the following command to access the Admin Console:

    ```bash
    kubectl kots admin-console --namespace NAMESPACE
    ```

    Replace `NAMESPACE` with the namespace where KOTS is installed.

1. Enter the password that you created in [Step 6: Install KOTS and the Application](tutorial-cli-install-app-manager) to log in to the Admin Console.

   The Admin Console dashboard opens. On the Admin Console **Dashboard** tab, users can take various actions, including viewing the application status, opening the application, checking for application updates, syncing their license, and setting up application monitoring on the cluster with Prometheus.

1. On the **Config** tab, select the **Customize Text Inputs** checkbox. In the **Text Example** field, enter any text. For example, `Hello`.

   This page displays configuration settings that are specific to the application. Software vendors define the fields that are displayed on this page in the KOTS Config custom resource. For more information, see [Config](/reference/custom-resource-config) in _Reference_.

1. Click **Save config**. In the dialog that opens, click **Go to updated version**.

    The **Version history** tab opens.

1. Click **Deploy** for the new version. Then click **Yes, deploy** in the confirmation dialog.
