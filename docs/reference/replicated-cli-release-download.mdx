# replicated release download

Download application manifests for a release.

### Synopsis

Download application manifests for a release to a specified file or directory.

For KOTS applications:
  - Downloads release as a .tgz file if no RELEASE_SEQUENCE specified
  - Can specify --channel to download the current release from that channel
  - Auto-generates filename as app-slug.tgz if --dest not provided

For non-KOTS applications, this is equivalent to the 'release inspect' command.

If no app is specified via --app flag, the app slug will be loaded from the .replicated config file.

```
replicated release download [RELEASE_SEQUENCE] [flags]
```

### Examples

```
# Download latest release as autoci.tgz
replicated release download

# Download specific sequence
replicated release download 42 --dest my-release.tgz

# Download current release from Unstable channel

# Download to directory (KOTS only with sequence)
replicated release download 1 --dest ./manifests
```

### Options
