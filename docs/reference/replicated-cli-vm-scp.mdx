# replicated vm scp

Copy files to/from a VM

### Synopsis

Securely copy files to or from a VM using SCP.

This command allows you to copy files between your local machine and a VM. You can specify the VM ID followed by a colon and the path on the VM, or just a local path.

To copy a file from your local machine to a VM, use:
replicated vm scp localfile.txt vm-id:/path/on/vm/

To copy a file from a VM to your local machine, use:
replicated vm scp vm-id:/path/on/vm/file.txt localfile.txt

If no VM ID is provided and multiple VMs are available, you will be prompted to select a VM.

The SSH user can be specified in order of precedence:
1. By specifying the -u flag
2. REPLICATED_SSH_USER environment variable
3. GITHUB_ACTOR environment variable (from GitHub Actions)
4. GITHUB_USER environment variable

Note: Only running VMs can be connected to via SCP.

```
replicated vm scp [VM_ID:]SOURCE [VM_ID:]DESTINATION [flags]
