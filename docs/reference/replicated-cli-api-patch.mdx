# replicated api patch

Make adhoc PATCH requests to the Vendor API v3. Uses your local credentials and prints the response unmodified. For more information, see the [Vendor API v3 documentation](https://replicated-vendor-api.readme.io/reference/createapp).

## Usage

```bash
replicated api patch [PATH]
```

Pass the PATH of the request as the final argument. Do not include the host or version. Replicated recommends piping the output to jq for easier reading.
