# replicated profile

Manage authentication profiles

### Synopsis

The profile command allows you to manage authentication profiles for the Replicated CLI.

Profiles let you store multiple sets of credentials and easily switch between them.
This is useful when working with different Replicated accounts (production, development, etc.)
or different API endpoints.

Credentials are stored in ~/.replicated/config.yaml with file permissions set to 600 (owner read/write only).

Authentication priority:
1. REPLICATED_API_TOKEN environment variable (highest priority)
2. --profile flag (per-command override)
3. Default profile from ~/.replicated/config.yaml
4. Legacy single token (backward compatibility)

Use the various subcommands to:
- Add new profiles
- Edit existing profiles
- List all profiles
- Remove profiles
- Set the default profile

### Examples

```
# Add a production profile (will prompt for token)
replicated profile add prod

# Add a production profile with token flag
replicated profile add prod --token=your-prod-token

# Add a development profile with custom API origin
replicated profile add dev --token=your-dev-token --api-origin=https://vendor-api-dev.com

# Edit an existing profile's API origin
replicated profile edit dev --api-origin=https://vendor-api-noahecampbell.okteto.repldev.com

# List all profiles
replicated profile ls

# Set default profile
replicated profile set-default prod

# Remove a profile
replicated profile rm dev
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for profile
```
