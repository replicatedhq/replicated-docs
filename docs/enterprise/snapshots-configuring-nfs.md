# Configuring NFS

> Introduced in the Replicated app manager v1.33.0

You can configure a Network File System (NFS) as your snapshots storage destination. For more information about snapshot storage destinations, see [Storage destinations](snapshots-storage-destinations).

Prerequisites:

* Make sure that you have the NFS server already set up and configured to allow access from all the nodes in the cluster.
* Make sure all the nodes in the cluster have the necessary NFS client packages installed to be able to communicate with the NFS server.
For example, the `nfs-common` package is a common package used on Ubuntu.
* Make sure that any firewalls are properly configured to allow traffic between the NFS server and clients (cluster nodes).

## Configure NFS on Kubernetes Installer-created Clusters

Clusters created by the Replicated Kubernetes installer that include the Velero add-on store snapshots internally in the cluster by default. For more information about the Velero add-on, see [Velero Add-On](https://kurl.sh/docs/add-ons/velero) in the kURL documentation.

There are two ways to change this configuration to use NFS:

* Using the kots CLI `velero configure-nfs` command. See [`velero configure-nfs`](../reference/kots-cli-velero-configure-nfs/) in the kots CLI documentation.
* Using the Replicated admin console. See the instructions below.

First, head to the "Snapshots" tab.
From there, head to the "Settings and Schedule" tab and choose the "Network File System (NFS)" dropdown option.

Enter the NFS server hostname or IP Address, and the path that is exported by the NFS server and click "Update storage settings".
This step might take a couple of minutes.

When configuring the admin console to store snapshots on an NFS server, the following fields are available:

| Name   | Description                                  |
|--------|----------------------------------------------|
| Server | The hostname or IP address of the NFS server |
| Path   | The path that is exported by the NFS server  |

## Existing Clusters

If Velero is already installed in the cluster, follow the instructions in the [Configure NFS on Kubernetes installer-created clusters](#configure-nfs-on-kubernetes-installer-created-clusters) section above.

If Velero is not yet installed in the cluster, then the first step would be to set up and deploy the necessary components that are going to be used to install and set up Velero with NFS.
This can be done in two ways:

### Using the kots CLI

The `velero configure-nfs` CLI command can be used to configure NFS for either online or air gapped installations.
After this command has run and completed successfully, it will detect if Velero is not installed and print out specific instructions on how to install and set up Velero.

**Online installations**

```bash
kubectl kots velero configure-nfs --nfs-server <hostname-or-ip> --nfs-path /path/to/directory --namespace <namespace>
```

**Air gapped installations**

```bash
kubectl kots velero configure-nfs \
  --nfs-server <hostname-or-ip> \
  --nfs-path /path/to/directory \
  --namespace <namespace> \
  --kotsadm-registry private.registry.host \
  --kotsadm-namespace application-name \
  --registry-username ro-username \
  --registry-password ro-password
```

### Using the Admin Console

First, head to the “Snapshots” tab.
From there, head to the “Settings and Schedule” tab.
Then, you'll be presented with a dialog which contains instructions for setting up Velero with different providers.
Click on the "NFS" provider option (check screenshot below).

Then, you'll be presented with another dialog for configuring NFS.
Enter the NFS server hostname or IP Address, and the path that is exported by the NFS server and click "Configure".

![Snapshot Provider NFS Fields](/images/snapshot-provider-nfs-fields.png)

This step might take a few minutes, so please be patient.
Once the configuration is successful, you'll be presented with a different dialog which contains a CLI command that will print out instructions on how to set up Velero with the deployed NFS configuration/components.

After following the instructions from the above CLI command and successfully installing Velero, you can go back to the admin console and either click on the "Check for Velero" button to retry detecting Velero, or refresh the page.
