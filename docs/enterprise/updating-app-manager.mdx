# Performing Updates in Existing Clusters

This topic describes how to perform updates in existing cluster installations with Replicated KOTS. It includes information about how to update applications and the version of KOTS running in the cluster.

## Update an Application

You can perform an application update using the KOTS Admin Console or the KOTS CLI. You can also set up automatic updates. See [Configuring Automatic Updates](/enterprise/updating-apps).

### Using the Admin Console

#### Online Environments

<AdminConsole/>

#### Air Gap Environments

<AdminConsoleAirGap/>

### Using the KOTS CLI

You can use the KOTS CLI [upstream upgrade](/reference/kots-cli-upstream-upgrade) command to update an application in existing cluster installations.

#### Online Environments

To update an application in online environments:

```bash
kubectl kots upstream upgrade APP_SLUG -n ADMIN_CONSOLE_NAMESPACE
```
Where:
* `APP_SLUG` is the unique slug for the application. See [Get the Application Slug](/vendor/vendor-portal-manage-app#slug) in _Managing Applications_.
* `ADMIN_CONSOLE_NAMESPACE` is the namespace where the Admin Console is running.

:::note
Add the `--deploy` flag to automatically deploy this version.
:::

#### Air Gap Environments

To update an application in air gap environments:

1. Get the new `.airgap` bundle for the target application release and ensure that it is available on your local machine.

1. Run the following command to update the application:

    ```bash
    kubectl kots upstream upgrade APP_SLUG \
      --airgap-bundle NEW_AIRGAP_BUNDLE \
      --kotsadm-registry REGISTRY_HOST[/REGISTRY_NAMESPACE] \
      --registry-username RO_USERNAME \
      --registry-password RO_PASSWORD \
      -n ADMIN_CONSOLE_NAMESPACE
    ```
    Replace:
    * `APP_SLUG` with the unique slug for the application. See [Get the Application Slug](/vendor/vendor-portal-manage-app#slug) in _Managing Applications_.
    * `NEW_AIRGAP_BUNDLE` with the `.airgap` bundle for the target application version. See [Download Air Gap Bundles from the Download Portal](/vendor/releases-download-airgap-bundles#download-portal).
    * `REGISTRY_HOST` with the private registry that contains the Admin Console images.
    * `REGISTRY_NAMESPACE` with the registry namespace where the images are hosted (Optional). 
    * `RO_USERNAME` and `RO_PASSWORD` with the username and password for an account that has read-only access to the private registry.
    * `ADMIN_CONSOLE_NAMESPACE` with the namespace where the Admin Console is running.

:::note
Add the `--deploy` flag to automatically deploy this version.

## Update KOTS

This section describes how to update the version of Replicated KOTS running in your cluster. For information about the latest versions of KOTS, see [KOTS Release Notes](/release-notes/rn-app-manager).

:::note
Downgrading KOTS to a version earlier than what is currently deployed is not supported.
:::

### Online Environments

To update KOTS in an online existing cluster:

1. Run _one_ of the following commands to update the KOTS CLI to the target version of KOTS:

    - **Install or update to the latest version**:

      ```
      curl https://kots.io/install | bash
      ```

    - **Install or update to a specific version**:

      ```
      curl https://kots.io/install/VERSION | bash
      ```
      Where `VERSION` is the target KOTS version.

    For more KOTS CLI installation options, including information about how to install or update without root access, see [Installing the KOTS CLI](/reference/kots-cli-getting-started).

1. Run the following command to update the KOTS Admin Console to the same version as the KOTS CLI:

   ```bash
   kubectl kots admin-console upgrade -n NAMESPACE
   ```
   Replace `NAMESPACE` with the namespace in your cluster where KOTS is installed.

### Air Gap Environments

To update KOTS in an existing air gap cluster:

1. Download the target version of the following assets from the download portal or from the [Releases](https://github.com/replicatedhq/kots/releases/latest) page in the KOTS GitHub repository:
   * KOTS Admin Console `kotsadm.tar.gz` bundle
   * KOTS CLI plugin

   For more information, see [Download Air Gap Bundles from the Download Portal](/vendor/releases-download-airgap-bundles#download-portal).
   
   Ensure that you can access the downloaded bundle from the environment where the Admin Console is running.

1. Install or update the KOTS CLI to the version that you downloaded. See [Manually Download and Install](/reference/kots-cli-getting-started#manually-download-and-install) in _Installing the KOTS CLI_.

1. <PushKotsImages/>

1. Run the following command using registry read-only credentials to update the KOTS Admin Console:

    ```
    kubectl kots admin-console upgrade \
      --kotsadm-registry REGISTRY_HOST \
      --registry-username RO_USERNAME \
      --registry-password RO_PASSWORD \
      -n NAMESPACE
    ```
    Replace:
    * `REGISTRY_HOST` with the same private registry from the previous step.
    * `RO_USERNAME` with the username for credentials with read-only permissions to the registry.
    * `RO_PASSWORD` with the password associated with the username.
    * `NAMESPACE` with the namespace on your cluster where KOTS is installed.

    For help information, run `kubectl kots admin-console upgrade -h`.
