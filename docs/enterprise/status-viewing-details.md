## About Application Status

To display application status on the Admin Console dashboard, KOTS aggregates the status of specific Kubernetes resources for the application.

The following resource types are supported for displaying application status:

* Deployment
* StatefulSet
* Service
* Ingress
* PersistentVolumeClaims (PVC)
* DaemonSet

Applications can specify one or more of the supported Kubernetes workloads listed above. KOTS watches all specified workloads for state changes.

For more information about how to interpret the application status displayed on the Admin Console dashboard, see [Resource Statuses](#resource-statuses) and [Aggregate Application Status](#aggregate-application-status) below. 

### Resource Statuses

Possible application statuses are Ready, Updating, Degraded, Unavailable, and Missing.
