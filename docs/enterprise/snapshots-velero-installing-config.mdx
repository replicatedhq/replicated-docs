# Configure Namespace Access and Memory Limit

This topic describes how to configure namespace access and the memory limit for Velero.

## Overview

The Replicated KOTS Admin Console requires access to the namespace where Velero is installed. If your Admin Console is running with minimal role-based-access-control (RBAC) privileges, you must enable the Admin Console to access Velero.

Additionally, if the application uses a large amount of memory, you can configure the default memory limit to help ensure that Velero runs successfully with snapshots.

## Configure Namespace Access

This section applies only to _existing cluster_ installations (online and air gap) where the Admin Console is running with minimal role-based-access-control (RBAC) privileges.

Run the following command to enable the Admin Console to access the Velero namespace:

```
kubectl kots velero ensure-permissions --namespace ADMIN_CONSOLE_NAMESPACE --velero-namespace VELERO_NAMESPACE
```
Replace:
* `ADMIN_CONSOLE_NAMESPACE` with the namespace on the cluster where the Admin Console is running.
* `VELERO_NAMESPACE` with the namespace on the cluster where Velero is installed.

For more information, see [`velero ensure-permissions`](/reference/kots-cli-velero-ensure-permissions/) in the KOTS CLI documentation. For more information about RBAC privileges for the Admin Console, see [Kubernetes RBAC](/vendor/packaging-rbac).

## Configure Memory Limit

This section applies to all online and air gap installations.

Velero sets default limits for the velero Pod and the node-agent (restic) Pod during installation. There is a known issue with restic that causes high memory usage, which can result in failures during backup creation when the Pod reaches the memory limit.
