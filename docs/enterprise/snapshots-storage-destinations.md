# Storage Destinations

The Replicated snapshot feature supports any compatible Velero storage provider. For more information, see [Providers](https://velero.io/docs/main/supported-providers/) in the Velero documentation.

The Replicated admin console has built-in support for configuring AWS, GCP, Azure, S3-Compatible object store, NFS Server, or local host path as destinations.

Although clusters created by the Replicated Kubernetes installer are preconfigured in the admin console to store backups in the locally-provisioned object store, this is sufficient for only rollbacks and downgrades. It is not a suitable configuration for disaster recovery. We recommend that you configure a storage destination that is external to the cluster in the admin console.

If the admin console is running with minimal role-based-access-control (RBAC) privileges, you must use the `kots velero ensure-permissions` command because the admin console requires access to the namespace in which Velero is installed.

For more information, see [`velero ensure-permissions`](../reference/kots-cli-velero-ensure-permissions/) in the kots CLI documentation.

For more information about RBAC priviledges for the admin console, see [Kubernetes RBAC](../vendor/packaging-rbac).

## Prerequisites for Cloud Configurations

* Existing clusters: Customers must install Velero before configuring snapshots. See [Basic Install](https://velero.io/docs/v1.6/basic-install/) in the Velero documentation.
* Kubernetes installer-created clusters: The vendor can provide the Velero add-on in the embedded cluster installation. If it is not provided, the snapshots configuration dialog in the admin console notifies you to install Velero before you can proceed with the configuration.
