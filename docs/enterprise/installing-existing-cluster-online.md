# Installing in an online (Internet-connected) environment

The most direct and simple way to install a KOTS application to a Kubernetes cluster is to deploy to an existing cluster that contains nodes that can access the internet.
In this scenario, the container images will be pulled from the upstream registries directly.

## KOTS install
To start, run the command that was provided by the application vendor:

```shell
kubectl kots install application-name
```

The kubectl plugin will walk you through the necessary steps to install the application:

```shell
$ kubectl kots install application-name
Enter the namespace to deploy to: application-name
  • Deploying Admin Console
    • Creating namespace ✓
    • Waiting for datastore to be ready ✓
Enter a new password to be used for the Admin Console: ••••••••
  • Waiting for Admin Console to be ready ✓

  • Press Ctrl+C to exit
  • Go to http://localhost:8800 to access the Admin Console

```

Once this has completed, the kots plugin will create a port-forward to the Admin Console interface.
The Admin Console API and Web server are exposed over a ClusterIP service in the namespace provided.
The port-forward will be active as long as the CLI is running. Pressing Ctrl+C will end the port forward.

Once this has completed, click the link, or visit `http://localhost:8800` to complete the setup using the Admin Console web-based UI.

## Web Based Setup

At this point, visit `http://localhost:8800` to complete the setup of the application.

### Unlock the Admin Console

Enter the password provided during the setup, and you'll be redirected to the "Upload License" screen.

### Provide a License File
At this point, the Admin Console is still just an admin console without an application.
Providing a license file will include the entitlements necessary to pull the manifest and images and start the application.
If the license is outdated, the latest license will be fetched and used instead.

Once the license file is installed, if airgapped installations are enabled, an option will be presented to proceed with an airgapped setup.
For information on how to install in an air gap environment, see [Installing on an embedded cluster](installing-embedded-cluster).
For now, this walk through will continue with an online installation.

### Config Screen
Most KOTS applications include some required and some optional configuration.
This is used to build the final deployable Kubernetes manifests for the application.
The config screen of the setup will prompt for initial values to use in the application.
These can be changed later, but must be completed to continue.

### Preflight Checks
Finally, Preflight checks (conformance tests) are executed against the target namespace and cluster to ensure that the environment meets the minimum requirements to support the application.

### Proxies

When installing behind a proxy, Admin Console needs to be able to use the proxy to communicate with the APIs on the internet as well as local services.
Both the `kots install` and `kots pull` commands provide arguments to specify proxy settings for the Admin Console containers.

If either `http-proxy` or `https-proxy` is specified, `no-proxy` should also be specified.  The `no-proxy` string should include all localhost addresses as well as the local network and Kubernetes cluster CIDRs.
For example:
```bash
kubectl kots install app --http-proxy http://10.128.0.3:3128 \
  --no-proxy localhost,127.0.0.1,10.0.0.0/8,10.138.0.82
```
If `copy-proxy-env` flag is specified, proxy settings will be read from the environment of the shell where the kots command is running.

For more information, see the [kots CLI documentation](https://kots.io/kots-cli/getting-started/).
