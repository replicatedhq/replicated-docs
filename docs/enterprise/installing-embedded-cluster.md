# Installing with the Kubernetes Installer

This article refers to installing an application and the Replicated admin console on a cluster created by the Replicated Kubernetes installer.

The Kubernetes installer is based on the open source kURL project, which is maintained by Replicated. For more information about installing with kURL, including advanced installation options, see the [kURL documentation](https://kurl.sh/docs/introduction/).

## Requirements

Before you install, ensure that you meet the system requirements. For more information, see [Kubernetes installer requirements](installing-embedded-cluster-requirements).

## Install in an Online Environment

To install the admin console on a cluster created by the Kubernetes installer, run the installation script provided by the application developer.

```bash
curl -sSL https://kurl.sh/supergoodtool | sudo bash
```

## Install in an Air Gapped Environment

To install in an air gapped environment, download the `.airgap` bundle, untar it, and run the install.sh script.

You can construct the URL for the bundle by prefixing the above online URL path with `/bundle` and adding `.tar.gz` to the end.

```bash
curl -LO https://k8s.kurl.sh/bundle/supergoodtool.tar.gz
tar xvzf supergoodtool.tar
cat install.sh | sudo bash -s airgap
```

The Kubernetes installer uses `.tar.gz` extension for a `.tar` file, hence the `-o *.tar`.

Note that the `.airgap` bundle above only includes the admin console components, which are required in order to install the application.

After this command completes, the application can be installed using the application `.airgap` bundle.

```bash
kubectl kots install myapp \
  --airgap-bundle ./myapp-1.0.165.airgap \
  --license-file ./license.yaml \
  --config-values ./config.yaml \
  --namespace default \
  --shared-password password
```

## Install with High Availability

Both online and air gapped installations can be configured in high-availability mode.

When installing on a highly available cluster, the script will prompt for a load balancer address.
The load balancer can be preconfigured by passing in the `load-balancer-address=<host:port>` flag.

This load balancer should be configured to distribute traffic to all healthy control plane nodes in its target list.
This should be a TCP forwarding load balancer.

The health check for an apiserver is a TCP check on the port the kube-apiserver listens on (default value :6443).

For more information on the kube-apiserver load balancer see [Create load balancer for kube-apiserver](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/independent/high-availability/#create-load-balancer-for-kube-apiserver) in the Kubernetes documentation.

In the absence of a load balancer, all traffic will be routed to the first primary.

```bash
curl -sSL https://kurl.sh/supergoodtool | sudo bash -s ha
```

or

```bash
cat install.sh | sudo bash -s airgap ha
```

## Join Primary and Secondary Nodes

Visit the `/cluster/manage` page in the admin console to generate scripts for joining additional secondary and primary nodes.

For air gapped installations, the `.airgap` bundle must also be downloaded and extracted on the remote node prior to running the join script.
