# KOTS Installation Requirements

This topic describes the requirements for installing in a Kubernetes cluster with Replicated KOTS.

:::note
This topic does not include any requirements specific to the application. Ensure that you meet any additional requirements for the application before installing.
:::

## Supported Browsers

The following table lists the browser requirements for the Replicated KOTS Admin Console with the latest version of KOTS.

| Browser              | Support     |
|----------------------|-------------|
| Chrome               | 66+         |
| Firefox              | 58+         |
| Opera                | 53+         |
| Edge                 | 80+         |
| Safari (Mac OS only) | 13+         |
| Internet Explorer    | Unsupported |

## Kubernetes Version Compatibility

Each release of KOTS maintains compatibility with the current Kubernetes version, and the two most recent versions at the time of its release. This includes support against all patch releases of the corresponding Kubernetes version.

Kubernetes versions that are not listed below are end-of-life (EOL) in upstream Kubernetes, and no longer supported by Replicated. For more information about Kubernetes versions, see [Release History](https://kubernetes.io/releases/) in the Kubernetes documentation.

Replicated recommends using a version of KOTS that is compatible with a supported Kubernetes version listed in the table below.

<KubernetesCompatibility/>

## Minimum System Requirements

To install KOTS in an existing cluster, your environment must meet the following minimum requirements:

* **KOTS Admin Console minimum requirements**: Clusters that have LimitRanges specified must support the following minimum requirements for the Admin Console:

  * **CPU resources and memory**: The Admin Console pod requests 100m CPU resources and 100Mi memory.

  * **Disk space**: The Admin Console requires a minimum of 5GB of disk space on the cluster for persistent storage, including:

    * **4GB for S3-compatible object store**: The Admin Console requires 4GB for an S3-compatible object store to store appplication archives, support bundles, and snapshots that are configured to use a host path and NFS storage destination. By default, KOTS deploys MinIO to satisfy this object storage requirement. During deployment, MinIO is configured with a randomly generated `AccessKeyID` and `SecretAccessKey`, and only exposed as a ClusterIP on the overlay network.

      :::note
      You can optionally install KOTS without MinIO by passing `--with-minio=false` with the `kots install` command. This installs KOTS as a StatefulSet using a persistent volume (PV) for storage. For more information, see [Installing KOTS in Existing Clusters Without Object Storage](/enterprise/installing-stateful-component-requirements).
      :::

    * **1GB for rqlite PersistentVolume**: The Admin Console requires 1GB for a rqlite StatefulSet to store version history, application metadata, and other small amounts of data needed to manage the application(s). During deployment, the rqlite component is secured with a randomly generated password, and only exposed as a ClusterIP on the overlay network.  

* **Supported operating systems**: The following are the supported operating systems for nodes:
  * Linux AMD64
  * Linux ARM64

* **Available StorageClass**: The cluster must have an existing StorageClass available. KOTS creates the required stateful components using the default StorageClass in the cluster. For more information, see [Storage Classes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/) in the Kubernetes documentation.  

* **Kubernetes version compatibility**: The version of Kubernetes running on the cluster must be compatible with the version of KOTS that you use to install the application. This compatibility requirement does not include any specific and additional requirements defined by the software vendor for the application.

  For more information about the versions of Kubernetes that are compatible with each version of KOTS, see [Kubernetes Version Compatibility](#kubernetes-version-compatibility) above.

* **OpenShift version compatibility**: For Red Hat OpenShift clusters, the version of OpenShift must use a supported Kubernetes version. For more information about supported Kubernetes versions, see [Kubernetes Version Compatibility](#kubernetes-version-compatibility) above.

* **Storage class**: The cluster must have an existing storage class available. For more information, see [Storage Classes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/) in the Kubernetes documentation.

* **Port forwarding**: To support port forwarding, Kubernetes clusters require that the SOcket CAT (socat) package is installed on each node.

  If the package is not installed on each node in the cluster, you see the following error message when the installation script attempts to connect to the Admin Console: `unable to do port forwarding: socat not found`.

  To check if the package that provides socat is installed, you can run `which socat`. If the package is installed, the `which socat` command prints the full path to the socat executable file. For example, `usr/bin/socat`.

  If the output of the `which socat` command is `socat not found`, then you must install the package that provides the socat command. The name of this package can vary depending on the node's operating system.

## RBAC Requirements

The user that runs the installation command must have at least the minimum role-based access control (RBAC) permissions that are required by KOTS. If the user does not have the required RBAC permissions, then an error message displays: `Current user has insufficient privileges to install Admin Console`.

The required RBAC permissions vary depending on if the user attempts to install KOTS with cluster-scoped access or namespace-scoped access:
* [Cluster-scoped RBAC Requirements (Default)](#cluster-scoped)
* [Namespace-scoped RBAC Requirements](#namespace-scoped)

### Cluster-scoped RBAC Requirements (Default) {#cluster-scoped}

By default, KOTS requires cluster-scoped access. With cluster-scoped access, a Kubernetes ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding are created that grant KOTS access to all resources across all namespaces in the cluster.

To install KOTS with cluster-scoped access, the user must meet the following RBAC requirements:
* The user must be able to create workloads, ClusterRoles, and ClusterRoleBindings.
* The user must have cluster-admin permissions to create namespaces and assign RBAC roles across the cluster.

### Namespace-scoped RBAC Requirements {#namespace-scoped}

KOTS can be installed with namespace-scoped access rather than the default cluster-scoped access. With namespace-scoped access, a Kubernetes Role and RoleBinding are automatically created that grant KOTS permissions only in the namespace where it is installed.

:::note
Depending on the application, namespace-scoped access for KOTS is required, optional, or not supported. Contact your software vendor for application-specific requirements.
:::

To install or upgrade KOTS with namespace-scoped access, the user must have _one_ of the following permission levels in the target namespace:
* Wildcard Permissions (Default)
* Minimum KOTS RBAC Permissions

See the sections below for more information.

#### Wildcard Permissions (Default)

By default, when namespace-scoped access is enabled, KOTS attempts to automatically create the following Role to acquire wildcard (`* * *`) permissions in the target namespace:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: "rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1"
  kind: "Role"
  metadata:
    name: "kotsadm-role"
  rules:
    - apiGroups: ["*"]
      resources: ["*"]
      verb: "*"
  ```

   To support this default behavior, the user must also have `* * *` permissions in the target namespace.

#### Minimum KOTS RBAC Permissions

In some cases, it is not possible to grant the user `* * *` permissions in the target namespace. For example, an organization might have security policies that prevent this level of permissions.

  If the user installing or upgrading KOTS cannot be granted `* * *` permissions in the namespace, then they can instead request the minimum RBAC permissions required by KOTS. Using the minimum KOTS RBAC permissions also requires manually creating a ServiceAccount, Role, and RoleBinding for KOTS, rather than allowing KOTS to automatically create a Role with `* * *` permissions.

  To use the minimum KOTS RBAC permissions to install or upgrade:

  1. Ensure that the user has the minimum RBAC permissions required by KOTS. The following lists the minimum RBAC permissions:

     ```yaml
      - apiGroups: [""]
        resources: ["configmaps", "persistentvolumeclaims", "pods", "secrets", "services", "limitranges"]
        verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"]
      - apiGroups: ["apps"]
        resources: ["daemonsets", "deployments", "statefulsets"]
        verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"]
      - apiGroups: ["batch"]
        resources: ["jobs", "cronjobs"]
        verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"]
      - apiGroups: ["networking.k8s.io", "extensions"]
        resources: ["ingresses"]
        verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"]
      - apiGroups: [""]
        resources: ["namespaces", "endpoints", "serviceaccounts"]
        verbs: ["get"]
      - apiGroups: ["authorization.k8s.io"]
        resources: ["selfsubjectaccessreviews", "selfsubjectrulesreviews"]
        verbs: ["create"]
      - apiGroups: ["rbac.authorization.k8s.io"]
        resources: ["roles", "rolebindings"]
        verbs: ["get"]
      - apiGroups: [""]
        resources: ["pods/log", "pods/exec"]
        verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create"]
      - apiGroups: ["batch"]
        resources: ["jobs/status"]
        verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
     ```

     :::note
     The minimum RBAC requirements can vary slightly depending on the cluster's Kubernetes distribution and the version of KOTS. Contact your software vendor if you have the required RBAC permissions listed above and you see an error related to RBAC during installation or upgrade.
     ::: 

   1. Save the following ServiceAccount, Role, and RoleBinding to a single YAML file, such as `rbac.yaml`:

      ```yaml
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: ServiceAccount
      metadata:
        labels:
          kots.io/backup: velero
          kots.io/kotsadm: "true"
        name: kotsadm
      ---
      apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
      kind: Role
      metadata:
        labels:
          kots.io/backup: velero
          kots.io/kotsadm: "true"
        name: kotsadm-role
      rules:
        - apiGroups: [""]
          resources: ["configmaps", "persistentvolumeclaims", "pods", "secrets", "services", "limitranges"]
          verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"]
        - apiGroups: ["apps"]
          resources: ["daemonsets", "deployments", "statefulsets"]
          verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"]
        - apiGroups: ["batch"]
          resources: ["jobs", "cronjobs"]
          verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"]
        - apiGroups: ["networking.k8s.io", "extensions"]
          resources: ["ingresses"]
          verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"]
        - apiGroups: [""]
          resources: ["namespaces", "endpoints", "serviceaccounts"]
          verbs: ["get"]
        - apiGroups: ["authorization.k8s.io"]
          resources: ["selfsubjectaccessreviews", "selfsubjectrulesreviews"]
          verbs: ["create"]
        - apiGroups: ["rbac.authorization.k8s.io"]
          resources: ["roles", "rolebindings"]
          verbs: ["get"]
        - apiGroups: [""]
          resources: ["pods/log", "pods/exec"]
          verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create"]
        - apiGroups: ["batch"]
          resources: ["jobs/status"]
          verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
      ---
      apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
      kind: RoleBinding
      metadata:
        labels:
          kots.io/backup: velero
          kots.io/kotsadm: "true"
        name: kotsadm-rolebinding
      roleRef:
        apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
        kind: Role
        name: kotsadm-role
      subjects:
        - kind: ServiceAccount
          name: kotsadm
      ```

    1. If the application contains any Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs), add the CRDs to the Role in the YAML file that you created in the previous step with as many permissions as possible: `["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"]`.

       :::note
       Contact your software vendor for information about any CRDs that are included in the application.
       :::

       **Example**

       ```yaml
       rules:
       - apiGroups: ["stable.example.com"]
         resources: ["crontabs"]
         verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"]
       ```
    
    1. Run the following command to create the RBAC resources for KOTS in the namespace:

        ```
        kubectl apply -f RBAC_YAML_FILE -n TARGET_NAMESPACE
        ```

        Replace:
        * `RBAC_YAML_FILE` with the name of the YAML file with the ServiceAccount, Role, and RoleBinding and that you created.
        * `TARGET_NAMESPACE` with the namespace where the user will install KOTS.

:::note
After manually creating these RBAC resources, the user must include both the `--ensure-rbac=false` and `--skip-rbac-check` flags when installing or upgrading. These flags prevent KOTS from checking for or attempting to create a Role with `* * *` permissions in the namespace. For more information, see [Prerequisites](installing-existing-cluster#prerequisites) in _Online Installation in Existing Clusters with KOTS_.

## Compatible Image Registries {#registries}

A private image registry is required for air gap installations with KOTS in existing clusters. You provide the credentials for a compatible private registry during installation. You can also optionally configure a local private image registry for use with installations in online (internet-connected) environments.

Private registry settings can be changed at any time. For more information, see [Configuring Local Image Registries](image-registry-settings).

KOTS has been tested for compatibility with the following registries:
