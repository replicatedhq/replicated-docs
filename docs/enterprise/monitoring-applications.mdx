# Configure Prometheus Monitoring in Existing Cluster KOTS Installations

This topic describes how to monitor applications and clusters with Prometheus in existing cluster installations with Replicated KOTS.

For information about how to access Prometheus, Grafana, and Alertmanager, see [Accessing Dashboards Using Port Forwarding](/enterprise/monitoring-access-dashboards).

For information about consuming Prometheus metrics externally in kURL installations, see [Consuming Prometheus Metrics Externally](monitoring-external-prometheus).

## Configure Prometheus Monitoring

For existing cluster installations with KOTS, users can install Prometheus in the cluster and then connect the Admin Console to the Prometheus endpoint to enable monitoring.

### Step 1: Install Prometheus in the Cluster {#configure-existing}

Replicated recommends that you use CoreOS's Kube-Prometheus distribution for installing and configuring highly available Prometheus on an existing cluster. For more information, see the [kube-prometheus](https://github.com/coreos/kube-prometheus) GitHub repository.

This repository collects Kubernetes manifests, Grafana dashboards, and Prometheus rules combined with documentation and scripts to provide easy to operate end-to-end Kubernetes cluster monitoring with Prometheus using the Prometheus Operator.

To install Prometheus using the recommended Kube-Prometheus distribution:

1. Clone the [kube-prometheus](https://github.com/coreos/kube-prometheus) repository to the device where there is access to the cluster.

1. Use `kubectl` to create the resources on the cluster:

   ```bash
   # Create the namespace and CRDs, and then wait for them to be available before creating the remaining resources
   kubectl create -f manifests/setup
   until kubectl get servicemonitors --all-namespaces ; do date; sleep 1; echo ""; done
   kubectl create -f manifests/
   ```

   For advanced and cluster-specific configuration, you can customize Kube-Prometheus by compiling the manifests using jsonnet. For more information, see the [jsonnet website](https://jsonnet.org/).

   For more information about advanced Kube-Prometheus configuration options, see [Customizing Kube-Prometheus](https://github.com/coreos/kube-prometheus#customizing-kube-prometheus) in the kube-prometheus GitHub repository.

### Step 2: Connect to a Prometheus Endpoint

To view graphs on the Admin Console dashboard, provide the address of a Prometheus instance installed in the cluster.

To connect the Admin Console to a Prometheus endpoint:

1. On the Admin Console dashboard, under Monitoring, click **Configure Prometheus Address**.
1. Enter the address for the Prometheus endpoint in the text box and click **Save**.

   Graphs appear on the dashboard shortly after saving the address.
