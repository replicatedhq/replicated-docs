# Installing with Embedded Cluster from the Command Line

This topic describes how to install an application with Replicated Embedded Cluster from the command line.

## Overview

You can use the command line to install an application with Replicated Embedded Cluster. A common use case for installing from the command line is to automate installation, such as performing headless installations as part of CI/CD pipelines.

To install from the command line, you provide all the necessary installation assets, such as the license file and the application config values, with the installation command rather than through the Admin Console UI. Any preflight checks defined for the application run automatically during headless installations from the command line rather than being displayed in the Admin Console.

## Prerequisite

Create a ConfigValues YAML file to define the configuration values for the application release. You will pass the ConfigValues file with the installation command. For air-gapped environments, ensure that the ConfigValues file can be accessed from the installation environment. 

For more information, see [Generating a ConfigValues File](/vendor/releases-configvalues).

## Online (Internet-Connected) Installation

To install with Embedded Cluster in an online environment:

1. Follow the steps provided in the Vendor Portal to download and untar the Embedded Cluster installation assets. For more information, see [Online Installation with Embedded Cluster](/enterprise/installing-embedded).

1. Run the following command to install:

    ```bash
    sudo ./APP_SLUG install --license-file PATH_TO_LICENSE \
      --config-values PATH_TO_CONFIGVALUES \
      --admin-console-password ADMIN_CONSOLE_PASSWORD
    ```

    Replace:
    * `APP_SLUG` with the unique slug for the application.
    * `LICENSE_FILE` with the customer license.
    * `ADMIN_CONSOLE_PASSWORD` with a password for accessing the Admin Console.
    * `PATH_TO_CONFIGVALUES` with the path to the ConfigValues file. See [Generating a ConfigValues File](/vendor/releases-configvalues).

## Air Gap Installation

To install with Embedded Cluster in an air-gapped environment:

1. Follow the steps provided in the Vendor Portal to download and untar the Embedded Cluster air gap installation assets. For more information, see [Air Gap Installation with Embedded Cluster](/enterprise/installing-embedded-air-gap).

1. Ensure that the Embedded Cluster installation assets are available on the air-gapped machine, then run the following command to install:

    ```bash
    sudo ./APP_SLUG install --license-file PATH_TO_LICENSE \
      --config-values PATH_TO_CONFIGVALUES \
      --admin-console-password ADMIN_CONSOLE_PASSWORD \
      --airgap-bundle PATH_TO_AIRGAP_BUNDLE
    ```

    Replace:
    * `APP_SLUG` with the unique slug for the application.
    * `LICENSE_FILE` with the customer license.
    * `PATH_TO_CONFIGVALUES` with the path to the ConfigValues file. See [Generating a ConfigValues File](/vendor/releases-configvalues).
    * `ADMIN_CONSOLE_PASSWORD` with a password for accessing the Admin Console.
    * `PATH_TO_AIRGAP_BUNDLE` with the path to the Embedded Cluster `.airgap` bundle for the release.
