# Kubernetes installer requirements

KOTS leverages the open-source kURL project to embed a new Kubernetes cluster into existing machines.

As such, any embedded installation includes additional system requirements. For information about the kURL system requirements, see [System Requirements](https://kurl.sh/docs/install-with-kurl/system-requirements) in the kURL documentation.

Root access *is* required for embedded cluster installations.
