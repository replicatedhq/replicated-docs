# Kubernetes Installer Requirements

To install on a cluster created by the Replicated Kubernetes installer, you must meet the following requirements:

* The Replicated Kubernetes installer is based on the open source kURL project, which is maintained by Replicated. You must meet the system requirements of the kURL project to use the Kubernetes installer. See [System Requirements](https://kurl.sh/docs/install-with-kurl/system-requirements) in the kURL documentation.
* Root access is required.

In addition to the requirements listed on this page, you must also meet the general system requirements as well as any additional requirements from your software vendor. For more information about the system requirements, see [General System Requirements](installing-general-requirements).
