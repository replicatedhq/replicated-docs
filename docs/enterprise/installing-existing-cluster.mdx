# Online Installation in Existing Clusters

<IntroExisting/>

## Prerequisites

Complete the following prerequisites:

<PrereqsExistingCluster/> 
<LicenseFile/>

## Install {#online}

To install KOTS and the application in an existing cluster:

1. Run one of these commands to install the Replicated KOTS CLI and KOTS. As part of the command, you also specify a name and version for the application that you will install.

    * **For the latest application version**:
    
      ```shell
      curl https://kots.io/install | bash
      kubectl kots install APP_NAME
      ``` 
    * **For a specific application version**:

      ```shell
      curl https://kots.io/install | bash
      kubectl kots install APP_NAME --app-version-label=VERSION_LABEL
      ```

    Replace, where applicable:
    
    <AppNameUI/>
  
    * `VERSION_LABEL` with the label for the version of the application to install. For example, `--app-version-label=3.0.1`.  

    **Examples:**

    ```shell
    curl https://kots.io/install | bash
    kubectl kots install application-name
    ``` 

    ```shell
    curl https://kots.io/install | bash
    kubectl kots install application-name --app-version-label=3.0.1
    ``` 

1. <InstallCommandPrompts/>

1. Access the Admin Console on port 8800. If the port forward is active, go to [http://localhost:8800](http://localhost:8800) to access the Admin Console.

      If you need to reopen the port forward to the Admin Console, run the following command:

      ```shell
      kubectl kots admin-console -n NAMESPACE
      ```
      Replace `NAMESPACE` with the namespace where KOTS is installed.

1. Log in with the password that you created during installation.
  
1. Upload your license file.

1. On the config screen, complete the fields for the application configuration options and then click **Continue**.

1. On the **Preflight checks** page, the application-specific preflight checks run automatically. Preflight checks  are conformance tests that run against the target namespace and cluster to ensure that the environment meets the minimum requirements to support the application. Click **Deploy**.

    :::note
    Replicated recommends that you address any warnings or failures, rather than dismissing them. Preflight checks help ensure that your environment meets the requirements for application deployment.
    :::
    
1. (Minimal RBAC Only) If you are installing with minimal role-based access control (RBAC), KOTS recognizes if the preflight checks failed due to insufficient privileges. When this occurs, a kubectl CLI preflight command displays that lets you manually run the preflight checks. The Admin Console then automatically displays the results of the preflight checks. Click **Deploy**.

The Admin Console dashboard opens.

On the Admin Console dashboard, the application status changes from Missing to Unavailable while the Deployment is being created. When the installation is complete, the status changes to Ready. For example:
