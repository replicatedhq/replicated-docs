&#42; Required only if the application uses the [Replicated private registry](/vendor/private-images-replicated).

**Note:** If monitoring outbound traffic attempts you may see an occasional attempted call to `updates.k0sproject.io`, approximately every 30 minutes. This is a feature of the upstream k0s project to check for k0s updates. The Embedded Cluster does not use this feature and blocking it in your firewall rules will not impact Replicated product functionality. In a coming [patch version](https://github.com/k0sproject/k0s/pull/6328) of upstream k0s 1.33 this probe can be disabled, and this probe chatter will be eliminated from Embedded Cluster. 

## About Firewalld Configuration

When Firewalld is enabled in the installation environment, Embedded Cluster modifies the Firewalld config to allow traffic over the pod and service networks and to open the required ports on the host. No additional configuration is required.

The following rule is added to Firewalld:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<zone target="ACCEPT">
  <interface name="cali+"/>
  <interface name="tunl+"/>
  <interface name="vxlan-v6.calico"/>
  <interface name="vxlan.calico"/>
  <interface name="wg-v6.cali"/>
  <interface name="wireguard.cali"/>
  <source address="[pod-network-cidr]"/>
  <source address="[service-network-cidr]"/>
</zone>
```

The following ports are opened in the default zone:

<table>
<tr>
  <th>Port</th>
  <th>Protocol</th>

<tr>
  <td>6443</td>
  <td>TCP</td>

<tr>
  <td>10250</td>
