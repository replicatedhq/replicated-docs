## About Firewalld Configuration

When Firewalld is enabled in the installation environment, Embedded Cluster modifies the Firewalld config to allow traffic over the pod and service networks and to open the required ports on the host. No additional configuration is required.

The following rule is added to Firewalld:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<zone target="ACCEPT">
  <interface name="cali+"/>
  <interface name="tunl+"/>
  <interface name="vxlan-v6.calico"/>
  <interface name="vxlan.calico"/>
  <interface name="wg-v6.cali"/>
  <interface name="wireguard.cali"/>
  <source address="[pod-network-cidr]"/>
  <source address="[service-network-cidr]"/>
</zone>
```

The following ports are opened in the default zone:

<table>
<tr>
  <th>Port</th>
  <th>Protocol</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>6443</td>
  <td>TCP</td>

<tr>
  <td>10250</td>
