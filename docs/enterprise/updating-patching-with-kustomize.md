# Patch with Kustomize

This topic describes how to use Kustomize to patch an application before deploying.

## Overview

Replicated KOTS uses Kustomize to let you make patches to an application outside of the options available in the KOTS Admin Console **Config** page. _Kustomizations_ are the Kustomize configuration objects, defined in `kustomization.yaml` files, that describe how to transform or generate other Kubernetes objects.

These kustomizations overlay the application resource files and can persist after release updates. For example, you can kustomize the number of replicas that you want to continually use in your environment or specify what `nodeSelectors` to use for a deployment.

For more information, see the [Kustomize website](https://kustomize.io).

## Limitation

For Helm charts deployed with version `kots.io/v1beta2` of the KOTS HelmChart custom resource, editing the downstream Kustomization files to make changes to the application before deploying is not supported. This is because KOTS does not use Kustomize when installing Helm charts with the `kots.io/v1beta2` HelmChart custom resource. For more information, see [About Distributing Helm Charts with KOTS](/vendor/helm-native-about).

## About the Directory Structure

You can patch an application with Kustomize from the **View files** page in the Admin Console. The **View files** page shows the Kubernetes manifest files for the application.

The following images shows an example of the file directory on the View files page:

For more information about each of the sections in the file directory, see the following sections:

- [Upstream](#upstream)
- [Base](#base)
- [Overlays](#overlays)
- [Rendered](#rendered)
- [skippedFiles](#skippedfiles)

### Upstream

The following table describes the `upstream` directory and whether custom changes persist after an update:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width="16%">Directory</th>
      <th width="15%">Changes Persist?</th>
      <th width="67%">Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
    <tr>
      <td><code>upstream</code></td>
      <td>No, except for the <code>userdata</code> subdirectory</td>
      <td><p>The <code>upstream</code> directory exactly mirrors the content pushed to a release.</p><p>Contains the template functions, preflight checks, support bundle, config options, license, and so on.</p><p>Contains a <code>userdata</code> subdirectory that includes user data files such as the license file and the config file.</p></td>
    </tr>
</table>

### Base

The following table describes the `base` directory and whether custom changes persist after an update:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width="16%">Directory</th>
      <th width="15%">Changes Persist?</th>
      <th width="67%">Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
    <tr>
      <td><code>base</code></td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td><p>After KOTS processes and renders the <code>upstream</code>, it puts those files in the <code>base</code> directory.</p><p>Only the deployable application files, such as files deployable with <code>kubectl apply</code>, are placed here.</p><p>Any non-deployable manifests, such as template functions, preflight checks, and configuration options, are removed.</p></td>
    </tr>
</table>


### Overlays

The `overlays` directory contains the following subdirectories that apply specific kustomizations to the `base` directory when deploying a version to the cluster.
 The following table describes the subdirectories and specifies whether the custom changes made in each subdirectory persist after an update.
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th width="16%">Subdirectory</th>
        <th width="15%">Changes Persist?</th>
        <th width="67%">Description</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
      <tr>
        <td><code>midstream</code></td>
        <td>No</td>
        <td>Contains KOTS-specific kustomizations, such as:<ul><li>Backup labels, such as those used to configure Velero.</li><li>Image pull secret definitions and patches to inject the <code>imagePullSecret</code> field into relevant manifests (such as deployments, stateful sets, and jobs).</li></ul></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>downstream</code></td>
        <td>Yes</td>
        <td><p>Contains user-defined kustomizations that are applied to the <code>midstream</code> directory and deployed to the cluster.</p><p>Only one <code>downstream</code> subdirectory is supported. It is automatically created and named <code>this-cluster</code> when the Admin Console is installed.</p><p>To add kustomizations, see <a href="#patch-an-application">Patch an Application</a>.</p></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>midstream/charts</code></td>
        <td>No</td>
        <td><p>Appears only when the <code>useHelmInstall</code> property in the HelmChart custom resource is set to <code>true</code>.</p><p>Contains a subdirectory for each Helm chart. Each Helm chart has its own kustomizations because each chart is rendered and deployed separately from other charts and manifests.</p><p>The subcharts of each Helm chart also have their own kustomizations and are rendered separately. However, these subcharts are included and deployed as part of the parent chart.</p></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>downstream/charts</code></td>
        <td>Yes</td>
        <td><p>Appears only when the <code>useHelmInstall</code> property in the HelmChart custom resource is set to <code>true</code>.</p><p>Contains a subdirectory for each Helm chart. Each Helm chart has its own kustomizations because each chart is rendered and deployed separately from other charts and manifests.</p><p>The subcharts of each Helm chart also have their own kustomizations and are rendered separately. However, these subcharts are included and deployed as part of the parent chart.</p></td>
      </tr>
  </table>

### Rendered

The following table describes the `rendered` directory and whether custom changes persist after an update:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width="16%">Directory</th>
      <th width="15%">Changes Persist?</th>
      <th width="67%">Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
    <tr>
      <td><code>rendered</code></td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td><p>Contains the final rendered application manifests that are deployed to the cluster.</p><p>The rendered files are created when KOTS processes the <code>base</code> by applying the corresponding overlays and the user-defined kustomizations. KOTS puts the rendered files in the <code>rendered</code> directory.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>rendered/charts</code></td>
      <td>No</td>
      <td><p>Appears only when the <code>useHelmInstall</code> property in the HelmChart custom resource is set to <code>true</code>.</p><p>Contains a subdirectory for each rendered Helm chart. Each Helm chart is deployed separately from other charts and manifests.</p><p>The rendered subcharts of each Helm chart are included and deployed as part of the parent chart.</p></td>
    </tr>
</table>

### skippedFiles

The `skippedFiles` directory lists files that KOTS is not able to process or render, such as invalid YAML files.

The `_index.yaml` file contains metadata and details about the errors, such as which files they were found in and sometimes the line number of the error.

## Patch an Application

To patch the application with Kustomize so that your changes persist between updates, edit the files in the `overlays/downstream/this-cluster` directory.

The Admin Console overwrites the `upstream` and `base` directories each time you upgrade the application to a later version.

To patch an application:

1. On the View Files tab in the Admin Console, click **Need to edit these files? Click here to learn how**.

   ![edit-patches-kots-app](/images/edit-patches-kots-app.png)

1. To download the application bundle locally:

   ```shell
   kubectl kots download --namespace APP_NAMESPACE --slug APP_SLUG
   ```
   Replace:
   * `APP_NAMESPACE` with the namespace on the cluster where the application is deployed.
   * `APP_SLUG` with the unique slug for the application.

   You can copy these values from the dialog that appears when you click **Need to edit these files? Click here to learn how**.

1. Create a Kubernetes manifest YAML file and make any desired edits. You only need to add the fields and values that you want to change because this patch file overwrites the corresponding values in the `base` directory. For example, the following `Deployment` patch manifest file shows an edit only to the number of replicas. None of the other values in the `base/deployment.yaml` file will be overwritten.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: example-nginx
   spec:
     replicas: 2
   ```

1. Add the filename that you created in the previous step to the `patches` field in the `kustomization.yaml` file, located in `/overlays/downstream/this-cluster`. The `downstream/this-cluster` subdirectory is where custom changes (patches) persist when releases are updated. These changes are in turn applied to the `midstream` directory. For more information, see [overlays](#overlays).

   **Example:**

   ```yaml
    apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
    bases:
    - ../../midstream
    kind: Kustomization
    patches:
    - path: ./FILENAME.yaml
   ```

1. Upload your changes to the cluster:

   ```shell
   kubectl kots upload --namespace APP_NAMESPACE --slug APP_SLUG ~/APP-SLUG
   ```

1. On the Version History tab in the Admin Console, click **Diff** to see the new version of the application with the diff of the changes that you uploaded.

   ![kustomize-view-history-diff](/images/kustomize-view-history-diff.png)

   [View a larger version of this image](/images/kustomize-view-history-diff.png)

1. Click **Deploy** to apply the changes.

   ![kustomize-view-history-deploy](/images/kustomize-view-history-deploy.png)

1. Verify your changes. For example, running the following command shows that there are two NGINX pods running after deploying two replicas in the example YAML above:

   ```shell
   kubectl get po | grep example-nginx
   ```
   **Example output:**

   ```shell
   example-nginx-f5c49fdf6-bf584         1/1     Running     0          1h
   example-nginx-t6ght74jr-58fhr         1/1     Running     0          1m
   ```
