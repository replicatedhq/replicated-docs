# General System Requirements

This topic describes the general system requirements for installing applications with the Replicated app manager.

There are additional requirements specific to installing an application on an existing cluster and installing an application on a cluster created by the Kubernetes installer.

For more information about requirements for existing clusters, see [Cluster requirements](installing-existing-cluster-requirements).

For more information about requirements for the Kubernetes installer, see [Kubernetes installer requirements](installing-embedded-cluster-requirements).

**Note**: This topic does not include any requirements specific to your software vendor. Ensure that you meet any additional requirements for the application defined by your software vendor.

## Kubernetes Version Compatibility

Each release of the open source KOTS project maintains compatibility with the current Kubernetes version, and the two most recent versions at the time of its release.

**Note**: The app manager is based on the open source KOTS project. The app manager version is the same as the KOTS version. For example, KOTS v1.48 is the same as the app manager v1.48.

This includes support against all patch releases of the corresponding Kubernetes version.

| KOTS versions   | Kubernetes compatibility |

| v1.11 to v1.14  | v1.17, v1.16, and v1.15   |
| v1.15 to v1.19  | v1.18, v1.17, and v1.16   |
| v1.20 to v1.35  | v1.19, v1.18, and v1.17   |
