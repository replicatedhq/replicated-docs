# Update Custom TLS Certificates in Embedded Cluster Installations

This topic describes how to update custom TLS certificates in Replicated Embedded Cluster installations.

## Update Custom TLS Certificates

Users can provide custom TLS certificates with Embedded Cluster installations and can update TLS certificates using the CLI or through the Admin Console.

### Update Using the CLI (Recommended)

:::note
The `admin-console update-tls` command is available in Embedded Cluster v2.13.2 and later.
:::

The `admin-console update-tls` command provides a secure way to update TLS certificates for the Admin Console. This method updates the `kotsadm-tls` Kubernetes secret directly. Pods watching this secret automatically reload the TLS configuration, so no restart is required.

To update TLS certificates using the CLI:

1. SSH onto a controller node where Embedded Cluster is installed. Ensure the TLS certificate and key files are present on the node.

1. Run the following command to update the TLS certificate and key:

   ```bash
   sudo ./APP_SLUG admin-console update-tls --tls-cert PATH_TO_CERT --tls-key PATH_TO_KEY
   ```

   Replace:
   - `APP_SLUG` with the unique slug of the installed application.
   - `PATH_TO_CERT` with the path to the TLS certificate file.
   - `PATH_TO_KEY` with the path to the TLS key file.

### Update Using the Admin Console

You can also update TLS certificates through the Admin Console. This method requires temporarily enabling anonymous uploads.

:::important
Adding the `acceptAnonymousUploads` annotation temporarily creates a vulnerability for an attacker to maliciously upload TLS certificates. After TLS certificates have been uploaded, the vulnerability is closed again.

Replicated recommends using the CLI method above when possible. If you use this method, complete the upload process quickly to minimize the vulnerability risk.

To upload a new custom TLS certificate through the Admin Console:

1. SSH onto a controller node where Embedded Cluster is installed. Then, run the following command to start a shell so that you can access the cluster with kubectl:

   ```bash
   sudo ./APP_SLUG shell
   ```
   Where `APP_SLUG` is the unique slug of the installed application.

1. In the shell, run the following command to restore the ability to upload new TLS certificates by adding the `acceptAnonymousUploads` annotation:

   ```bash
   kubectl -n kotsadm annotate secret kotsadm-tls acceptAnonymousUploads=1 --overwrite
   ```

1. Run the following command to get the name of the kurl-proxy server:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -A | grep kurl-proxy | awk '{print $2}'
   ```
   :::note
   This server is named `kurl-proxy`, but is used in both Embedded Cluster and kURL installations.
   :::

1. Run the following command to delete the kurl-proxy pod. The pod automatically restarts after the command runs.

   ```bash
   kubectl delete pods PROXY_SERVER
   ```

   Replace `PROXY_SERVER` with the name of the kurl-proxy server that you got in the previous step.

1. After the pod has restarted, go to `http://<ip>:30000/tls` in your browser and complete the process in the Admin Console to upload a new certificate.
