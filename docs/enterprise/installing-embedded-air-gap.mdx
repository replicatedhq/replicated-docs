# Installing in Air Gap Environments with Embedded Cluster (Alpha)

This topic describes how to install applications with Embedded Cluster in air gap environments with no outbound internet access.

:::important
Embedded Cluster installations in air gap environments in an Alpha feature. This feature is subject to change, including breaking changes. To get access to this feature, reach out to Alex Parker at [alexp@replicated.com](mailto:alexp@replicated.com).
:::

## Overview

When an air gap bundle is built for a release containing an Embedded Cluster config, both an application air gap bundle and an Embedded Cluster air gap bundle are built, so it is possible do an air gap installation with KOTS/kURL or with Embedded Cluster.

The Embedded Cluster air gap bundle not only contains the artifacts normally contained in an application air gap bundle (`airgap.yaml`, `app.tar.gz`, and an images directory), but it also contains an `embedded-cluster` directory with the artifacts needed to install the infrastructure (Embedded Cluster/k0s and [Helm extensions](/reference/embedded-config#helm-extensions)).

During installation with Embedded Cluster in air gap environments, a Docker registry is deployed to the cluster to store application images. Infrastructure images (for Embedded Cluster and Helm extensions) and the Helm charts are preloaded on each node at installation time.

## Requirement

Air gap installations are supported with Embedded cluster version 1.3.0 or later.

## Limitations and Known Issues

Embedded Cluster installations in air gap environments have the following limitations and known issues:

* This iteration of air gap installations is not highly available. If the original node is deleted, all registry and KOTS data will be lost. Multi-node HA will be added later for online and air gap installations.

* If you pass `?airgap=true` to the `replicated.app` endpoint but an air gap bundle is not built for the latest release, the API will not return a 404. Instead it will return the tarball without the air gap bundle (as in, with the installer and the license in it, like for online installations).

* Images used by Helm extensions must not refer to a multi-architecture image by digest. Only x64 images are included in air gap bundles, and the digest for the x64 image will be different from the digest for the multi-architecture image, preventing the image from being discovered in the bundle. An example of a chart that does this is ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx chart. For an example of how the digests should be set to empty string to pull by tag only, see [Helm Extensions](/reference/embedded-config#helm-extensions) in _Embedded Cluster Config_.

* Images for Helm extensions are loaded directly into containerd so that they are available without internet access. But if an image used by a Helm extension has **Always set as the image pull policy**, Kubernetes will try to pull the image from the internet. If necessary, use the Helm values to set `IfNotPresent` as the image pull policy to ensure the extension works in air gap environments.

* On the channel release history page, the links for **Download air gap bundle**, **Copy download URL**, and **View bundle contents** pertain to the application air gap bundle only, not the Embedded Cluster bundle.

## Install

To install with Embedded Cluster in air gap environments:

1. Create a release with an Embedded Cluster config and promote it to a channel. For more information, see [Managing Releases with the Vendor Portal](/vendor/releases-creating-releases) and [Embedded Cluster Config](/reference/embedded-config).

1. Build the air gap bundle for the release:
     * If the **Automatically create airgap builds for newly promoted releases in this channel** setting is enabled on the channel, watch for the build status to complete.
     * If automatic air gap builds are not enabled, go to the **Release history** page for the channel and build the air gap bundle manually.
     
     For more information, see [Downloading Air Gap Bundles](/vendor/releases-download-airgap-bundles#air-gap-bundle).
     
    :::note
    Errors in building either the application air gap bundle or the Embedded Cluster infrastructure will be shown if present.
    :::

1. Go to the customer page for the customer you want to use for the air gap installation. Click **Install instructions > Embedded cluster** to open the **Embedded Cluster installation instructions** dialog. For more information, see [Download the Embedded Cluster Binary](/vendor/embedded-overview#using-the-replicated-app-service) in _Using Embedded Cluster_.
    
     ![Customer install instructions drop down button](/images/customer-install-instructions-dropdown.png)
     [View a larger version of this image](/images/customer-install-instructions-dropdown.png)

1. Modify the curl command provided in the first step in the **Embedded Cluster installation instructions** dialog by adding the `?airgap=true` query parameter to the end of the `replicated.app` endpoint. For example:

    ```bash
    curl https://replicated.app/embedded/APP_SLUG/CHANNEL_SLUG?airgap=true -H "Authorization: LICENSE_ID" -o 	APP_SLUG-CHANNEL_SLUG.tgz
    ```

1. Run the modified curl command on your air gapped VM to download the air gap installation artifacts.

1. After the download completes, untar it following the instructions provided in the **Embedded Cluster installation instructions** dialog. This will produce three files:
    * The installer
    * The license
    * The air gap bundle (`APP_SLUG.airgap`)

1. Install the application with the installation command copied from the **Embedded Cluster installation instructions** dialog, adding `--airgap-bundle` flag to pass the `.airgap` bundle that you downloaded to the installation:

    ```bash
    sudo ./APP_SLUG install --license license.yaml --airgap-bundle APP_SLUG.airgap
    ```
    Where `APP_SLUG` is the unique application slug.

## Add Nodes to Air Gap Clusters

You can add nodes to an air gap cluster. This involves downloading the Embedded Cluster artifacts to each node, copying a join command from the Admin Console, and running the join command on each node.

### Prerequisites

The Embedded Cluster binary and the air gap bundle must be present on each node you want to join to the cluster. Use the same commands as you did during installation to download and untar these artifacts on each node. For more information about how to download and untar the artifacts, see [Install](#install) above.

### Add Nodes

To add nodes to a cluster after successfully installing the first node:

1. Click the link in the install output to access the Admin Console. Proceed through the setup steps until you reach the **Nodes** page.

1. Click **Add node**, choose one or more node roles (if present), and copy the join command.

1. SSH onto another machine you want to join to the cluster. Run the join command on this node. For example:

    ```bash
    sudo ./APP_SLUG join --airgap-bundle APP_SLUG.airgap 10.128.0.32:30000 TxXboDstBAamXaPdleSK7Lid
    ```

1. When you have finished adding all nodes, return to the Admin Console and click **Continue**.

## Perform Updates in Air Gap Clusters

<DoNotDowngrade/>

<UpdateAirGapOverview/>

### Prerequisites

Before performing an upgrade in an air gap cluster with Embedded Cluster, complete the following prerequisites:

1. Create a new release with your changes and promote it to the same channel. This new release can include a different (and later) version of Embedded Cluster and/or changes to your application.

1. Build the air gap bundle for the release:
     * If the **Automatically create airgap builds for newly promoted releases in this channel** setting is enabled on the channel, watch for the build status to complete.
     * If automatic air gap builds are not enabled, go to the **Release history** page for the channel and build the air gap bundle manually.
     
     For more information, see [Downloading Air Gap Bundles](/vendor/releases-download-airgap-bundles#air-gap-bundle).
     
    :::note
    Errors in building either the application air gap bundle or the Embedded Cluster infrastructure will be shown if present.

After the air gap bundle is built, continue to [Upload the New Version From the Command Line](#upgrade-cli) or [Upload the New Version From the Admin Console](#upgrade-ui) to download the bundle and upgrade.
