# Configuring role based access control

It is also possible to regulate access to the Admin Console resources based on the roles of individual users within your organization.

To begin, click the Access link at the top of the Admin Console. Then click on "Add a group" under the "Role Based Access Control" section.

Then, enter a group name that matches one of the group names already established with your identity provider.
Next, choose one of the pre-defined Admin Console roles to be assigned to that group, and click "Add group".

For a list of admin console roles, see [Admin console roles](#admin-console-roles) below.
