# Kubernetes Installer Release Notes

## v2022.11.10-1

Released on November 10, 2022

### Bug Fixes {#bug-fixes-v2022-11-10-1}
* Fixes an issue where [KOTS add-on](https://kurl.sh/docs/add-ons/kotsadm) version 1.89.0+ fails to install when a proxy is configured.

## v2022.11.10-0

Released on November 10, 2022

### Improvements {#improvements-v2022-11-10-0}
* OpenEBS Local PV Storage Class will now be the default if no other Storage Class is specified for OpenEBS add-on versions 3.3.0 and above. Previously, OpenEBS was only the default if `openebs.localPVStorageClassName` was set to `"default"`.

### Bug Fixes {#bug-fixes-v2022-11-10-0}
* Fixes an issue that could cause installations or upgrades to fail with error "syntax error: operand expected (error token is ""0" + "1"")" on RHEL 7 based distributions.
* Fixes an issue that causes installations to fail with no default Storage Class for specs with `openebs.localPVStorageClassName` set to anything other than `"default"` and no other CSI add-on specified.

## v2022.11.09-0

Released on November 9, 2022

### New Features {#new-features-v2022-11-09-0}
* Adds [EKCO add-on](https://kurl.sh/docs/add-ons/ekco) version 0.25.0. This version adds management of the rqlite StatefulSet deployed by the app manager. If a Kubernetes installer cluster has at least three healthy nodes and the OpenEBS localpv storage class is available, rqlite is scaled up to three replicas for data replication and high availability.

Released on November 7, 2022

### New Features {#new-features-v2022-11-07-0}

It is recommended to use the [OpenEBS add-on](https://kurl.sh/docs/add-ons/openEBS#localpv) for the single-node LocalPV use case with kURL. For more information about this decision, see the [ADR](https://github.com/replicatedhq/kURL/blob/main/docs/arch/adr-007-deprecate-k3s-and-rke2.md).

For migration information, see [Migrating to Change kURL CSI Add-ons](https://kurl.sh/docs/install-with-kurl/migrating-csi).
* Updates the kurlsh/s3cmd image to tag 20221029-37473ee for [Registry add-on](https://kurl.sh/docs/add-ons/registry) version 2.8.1 and [Velero add-on](https://kurl.sh/docs/add-ons/velero) version 1.9.2, to address the high severity CVE: CVE-2022-43680.

* Fixes an issue that could cause the kURL installer to disable EKCO management of the internal load balancer during an upgrade. See [Internal Load Balancer](https://kurl.sh/docs/add-ons/ekco#internal-load-balancer).
* Fixes an issue where [Weave add-on](https://kurl.sh/docs/add-ons/weave) "latest" version resolves to 2.6.5-20221006 instead of 2.6.5-20221025.
* Fixes an issue where kURL will migrate to both OpenEBS Local PV and Longhorn from Rook-backed PersistentVolumeClaims when both add-ons are included in the specification and Rook is removed. kURL now prefers to migrate to OpenEBS.
