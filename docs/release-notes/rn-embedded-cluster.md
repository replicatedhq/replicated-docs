# Embedded Cluster Release Notes

This topic contains release notes for the [Replicated Embedded Cluster](/vendor/embedded-overview) installer. The release notes list new features, improvements, bug fixes, known issues, and breaking changes.

Additionally, these release notes list the versions of Kubernetes and Replicated KOTS that are available with each version of Embedded Cluster.


## 1.16.0

Released on October 23, 2024

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Version</th>
    <td id="center">1.16.0+k8s-1.30</td>
    <td id="center">1.16.0+k8s-1.29</td>

    <td id="center" colspan="2">1.119.0</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### New Features {#new-features-1-16-0}
* Adds support for Kubernetes 1.30 and removes support for 1.28.
* Adds a `--data-dir` flag to the `install` and `restore` commands so the data directory can be specified. By default, the data directory is `/var/lib/embedded-cluster`. If the `--data-dir` flag was provided at install time, then the same data directory must be provided when restoring. For more information, see [Embedded Cluster Install Command Options](/reference/embedded-cluster-install) and [Disaster Recovery for Embedded Cluster](/vendor/embedded-disaster-recovery).
* Adds an `admin-console reset-password` command that allows resetting the password for the Admin Console.
* Adds a `--cidr` flag to the `install` command that replaces the `--pod-cidr` and `--service-cidr` flags. The CIDR range specified with the `--cidr` flag is split and used for both the Pod and Service CIDRs. See [Embedded Cluster Install Command Options](/reference/embedded-cluster-install).
   :::note
   The `--pod-cidr` and `--service-cidr` flags are hidden, but still functional. Replicated recommends that you update any automation that uses the `--pod-cidr` and 
   `--service-cidr` flags to use the `--cidr` flag instead.
   :::
* Adds the following preflight checks:
  * Verify that the CIDR range used for the cluster does not overlap with existing routes.
  * Verify the CPU supports x86-64-v2.
  * Verify the data directory (`/var/lib/embedded-cluster` by default) is not symlinked.

### Improvements {#improvements-1-16-0}
* For new installations, the `k0s` and `openebs-local` directories are now subdirectories of `/var/lib/embedded-cluster`. With this change, Embedded Cluster now only documents and includes preflight checks for `/var/lib/embedded-cluster`.
* Improves the reliability of waiting for the Kubernetes server to start.
* Collects more information about the cluster in support bundles, including the Local Artifact Mirror and Kubernetes API Server logs.
* Requires that the Admin Console password is at least six characters.
* Improves the flexibility of configuring the Cluster Resources collector in support bundle specs by limiting KOTS's default collection to its own namespace.

### Bug Fixes {#bug-fixes-1-16-0}
* Fixes an issue that could occur when resetting a worker node that used a custom data directory.
* Fixes an issue where k0s images were not updated within the cluster when k0s was upgraded.
* Fixes an issue where upgrading a cluster with a worker node that used a version of Embedded Cluster earlier than 1.15 would fail.
* Fixes an issue that prevented you from upgrading to an application version that didn't have Config and preflights.
* Fixes an issue where the Admin Console could reach out the internet when generating a support bundle in air gap environments.
* Fixes an issue that prevented you from installing Embedded Cluster using a multi-channel license and a channel other than the license's default.
* Fixes an issue that could cause the registry to fail to upgrade in air gap installations.
* Fixes an issue where the Replicated SDK failed to deploy if a private CA was provided to the installation but the SDK was installed into a different namespace than KOTS.
* If an application includes the Replicated SDK, the SDK will be deployed with the same ClusterRole as the Admin Console.

## 1.15.0 - Removed

:::important
Embedded Cluster 1.15.0 has been removed and is not available for use because of issues with upgrades. It continues to work for anyone already using it.

</table>

### Improvements {#improvements-1-14-2}

* Preflight checks for the Admin Console and local artifact mirror ports now take into consideration ports specified by the user with the `--admin-console-port` and `--local-artifact-mirror-port` flags.
* Improves the display of preflight failures so they're more readable.

## 1.14.1

Released on September 26, 2024

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Version</th>
    <td id="center">1.14.1+k8s-1.29</td>
    <td id="center">1.14.1+k8s-1.28</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>KOTS Version</th>
    <td id="center" colspan="2">1.117.3</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### New Features {#new-features-1-14-1}

* Adds host preflight checks to ensure that the required ports are open and available. For more information, see [Port Requirements](/vendor/embedded-overview#port-requirements).

### Improvements {#improvements-1-14-1}

* Adds the `--network-interface` flag for the `join` command so a network interface can optionally be selected when joining nodes. If this flag is not provided, the first valid, non-local network interface is used.
* The `reset` command now automatically reboots the machine, and the optional `--reboot` flag is no longer available. A reboot is required to reset iptables.

### Bug Fixes {#bug-fixes-1-14-1}

* Fixes an issue where nodes could fail to join with the error "unable to get network interface for address."

## 1.14.0

Released on September 24, 2024

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Version</th>
    <td id="center">1.14.0+k8s-1.29</td>
    <td id="center">1.14.0+k8s-1.28</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Kubernetes Version</th>
    <td id="center">1.29.8</td>
    <td id="center">1.28.11</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>KOTS Version</th>
    <td id="center" colspan="2">1.117.3</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### New Features {#new-features-1-14-0}

* Introduces the `--admin-console-port` and `--local-artifact-mirror-port` flags to the `install` command so the ports for the Admin Console (default 30000) and the local artifact mirror (default 50000) can be chosen.
* Introduces the `--local-artifact-mirror-port` flag to the `restore` command so the port used for the local artifact mirror can be selected during the restore. If no port is provided, the port in use when the backup was taken will be used.
* Introduces the `--network-interface` flag to the `install` command so a network interface can be selected. If a network interface is not provided, the first valid, non-local network interface is used.

### Improvements {#improvements-1-14-0}

* When a proxy server is configured, the default network interface's subnet will automatically be added to the no-proxy list if the node's IP address isn't already included.
* When joining nodes to an Embedded Cluster, the correct network interface is chosen based on the node IP address in the join command.
* The static IP addresses for replicated.app and proxy.replicated.com are now included in the failure messages for the preflight checks that verify connectivity to those endpoints, making it easier for end users to allowlist those endpoints.
* If the Replicated SDK is deployed by KOTS as part of an application, the SDK will automatically be configured with any additional CA certificates provided to `--private-ca` flag for the `install` command.


## 1.13.1

Released on September 20, 2024

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Version</th>

</table>

### Bug Fixes {#bug-fixes-1-13-1}

* Fixes an issue where you could not upgrade to a version that had special characters like `+` in the version label.

## 1.13.0

Released on September 17, 2024

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Version</th>
    <td id="center">1.13.0+k8s-1.29</td>
    <td id="center">1.13.0+k8s-1.28</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>KOTS Version</th>
    <td id="center" colspan="2">1.117.0</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### New Features {#new-features-1-13-0}

* Adds the [`PrivateCACert` template function](/reference/template-functions-static-context#privatecacert) to return the name of a ConfigMap containing additional trusted CA certificates provided by the end user with the `--private-ca` flag for the `install` command.

### Bug Fixes {#bug-fixes-1-13-0}

* Fixes an issue where user-provided proxy configuration was removed during upgrades.
* Fixes an issue where the disk performance preflight failed on certain architectures where fio was unable to run.

## 1.12.1

Released on September 13, 2024

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Version</th>
    <td id="center">1.12.1+k8s-1.29</td>
    <td id="center">1.12.1+k8s-1.28</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Kubernetes Version</th>
    <td id="center">1.29.8</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>KOTS Version</th>
    <td id="center" colspan="2">1.116.1</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### New Features {#new-features-1-12-1}

* Adds the ability to provide additional trusted certificate authority certificates with the `install` command's `--private-ca` flag. This is useful when Embedded Cluster is installed behind an enterprise proxy that intercepts traffic and issues its own certificates.

### Bug Fixes {#bug-fixes-1-12-1}

* Removes unnecessary values that were previously added to the no proxy list automatically.
* KOTS now uses the fully qualified `.svc.cluster.local` address when making requests to the `kotsadm-rqlite` service to simplify HTTP proxy configuration.

## 1.12.0

Released on September 11, 2024

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Version</th>
    <td id="center">1.12.0+k8s-1.29</td>
    <td id="center">1.12.0+k8s-1.28</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>KOTS Version</th>
    <td id="center" colspan="2">1.116.0</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Improvements {#improvements-1-12-0}

* Available updates and the check for updates button are shown on the **Dashboard** page of the Admin Console. The check for updates button is now also shown on the **Version history** page. These were removed in a previous version.
* The **Nodes** page displays guidance and easier access to the node join command during initial install.
* When nodes need to be added to the cluster during a restore operation, the `join` command is more clearly shown in the Admin Console.
* Hides a banner on the **View Files** page that told users to use `kubectl kots` commands that are not intended for Embedded Cluster.
* KOTS now uses the fully qualified `.svc.cluster.local` address when making requests to the `kotsadm-rqlite` and `kotsadm-minio` services for simplified HTTP proxy configuration using `NO_PROXY=.cluster.local`.

### Bug Fixes {#bug-fixes-1-12-0}

* Fixes an issue where the values provided to the `--http-proxy`, `--https-proxy`, and `--no-proxy` flags for the kots install command were not propagated to the Replicated SDK.

## 1.11.1

Released on August 30, 2024

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Version</th>
    <td id="center">1.11.1+k8s-1.29</td>
    <td id="center">1.11.1+k8s-1.28</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Kubernetes Version</th>
    <td id="center">1.29.7</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>KOTS Version</th>
    <td id="center" colspan="2">1.114.0</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Improvements {#improvements-1-11-1}

* Adds a host preflight check to ensure that disk performance is sufficient for etcd. Specifically, the P99 write latency must be less than 10 ms.

## 1.11.0

Released on August 23, 2024

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Version</th>
    <td id="center">1.11.0+k8s-1.29</td>
    <td id="center">1.11.0+k8s-1.28</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Kubernetes Version</th>
    <td id="center">1.29.7</td>
    <td id="center">1.28.11</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>KOTS Version</th>
    <td id="center" colspan="2">1.114.0</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Improvements {#improvements-1-11-0}

* The default range available for NodePorts is now 80-32767 instead of 30000-32767. Many customers used [`unsupportedOverrides`](/reference/embedded-config#unsupportedoverrides) to configure this wider range for use with things like an ingress controller, so we have adjusted the default range accordingly. Changes to this range are not applied on upgrades, so existing installations will not be changed.
* Adds host preflight checks for connecting to replicated.app and proxy.replicated.com. If you use a custom domain for replicated.app, the custom domain will be used in the preflight check.
* Adds a host preflight check to ensure that neither `nameserver localhost` nor `nameserver 127.0.0.1` is present in `resolv.conf`.

### Bug Fixes {#bug-fixes-1-11-0}

* Fixes several issues that caused node resets to fail. Single-node clusters are no longer drained before being reset. Resets will no longer fail with the error `unable to get installation` if the installation failed early on. And node resets will now work if bind mounts are used for `/var/lib/embedded-cluster`, `/var/lib/k0s`, and `/var/openebs`.
* Fixes an issue where preflight checks for `modprobe`, `mount`, and `unmount` in `PATH` did not use absolute paths.
* Fixes an issue where restoring did not work with S3-compatible object stores other than AWS S3.

## 1.10.0

Released on August 13, 2024

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Version</th>
    <td id="center">1.10.0+k8s-1.29</td>
    <td id="center">1.10.0+k8s-1.28</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Kubernetes Version</th>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>KOTS Version</th>
    <td id="center" colspan="2">1.114.0</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### New Features {#new-features-1-10-0}

* Adds support for the `dropdown` config item type, which creates a dropdown on the config screen. See [`dropdown`](/reference/custom-resource-config#dropdown) in Config.
* Adds the `radio` config item type, which is functionally equivalent to the `select_one` item type but is more clearly named. The `select_one` config item type is deprecated in favor of `radio` but is still fully functional. See [`radio`](/reference/custom-resource-config#radio) in _Config_.
