    <th>Version</th>

</table>

### Improvements {#improvements-1-11-1}

* Adds a host preflight check to ensure that disk performance is sufficient for etcd. Specifically, the P99 write latency must be less than 10 ms.

## 1.11.0

Released on August 23, 2024

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Version</th>
    <td id="center">1.11.0+k8s-1.29</td>
    <td id="center">1.11.0+k8s-1.28</td>

    <td id="center" colspan="2">1.114.0</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Improvements {#improvements-1-11-0}

* The default range available for NodePorts is now 80-32767 instead of 30000-32767. Many customers used [`unsupportedOverrides`](/reference/embedded-config#unsupportedoverrides) to configure this wider range for use with things like an ingress controller, so we have adjusted the default range accordingly. Changes to this range are not applied on upgrades, so existing installations will not be changed.
* Adds host preflight checks for connecting to replicated.app and proxy.replicated.com. If you use a custom domain for replicated.app, the custom domain will be used in the preflight check.
* Adds a host preflight check to ensure that neither `nameserver localhost` nor `nameserver 127.0.0.1` is present in `resolv.conf`.

### Bug Fixes {#bug-fixes-1-11-0}

* Fixes several issues that caused node resets to fail. Single-node clusters are no longer drained before being reset. Resets will no longer fail with the error `unable to get installation` if the installation failed early on. And node resets will now work if bind mounts are used for `/var/lib/embedded-cluster`, `/var/lib/k0s`, and `/var/openebs`.
* Fixes an issue where preflight checks for `modprobe`, `mount`, and `unmount` in `PATH` did not use absolute paths.
* Fixes an issue where restoring did not work with S3-compatible object stores other than AWS S3.

## 1.10.0

Released on August 13, 2024

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Version</th>

  </tr>
</table>

### New Features {#new-features-1-10-0}

* Adds support for the `dropdown` config item type, which creates a dropdown on the config screen. See [`dropdown`](/reference/custom-resource-config#dropdown) in Config.
* Adds the `radio` config item type, which is functionally equivalent to the `select_one` item type but is more clearly named. The `select_one` config item type is deprecated in favor of `radio` but is still fully functional. See [`radio`](/reference/custom-resource-config#radio) in _Config_.
