## 1.113.0

:::important
In KOTS 1.113.0 and later, an installation error can occur if you use the `kots install` command without specifying a channel slug _and_ the license used to install does not have access to the Stable channel. For more information, see [Breaking Change](#breaking-changes-1-113-0) below.
:::

Released on August 9, 2024

Support for Kubernetes: 1.28, 1.29, and 1.30

### New Features {#new-features-1-113-0}
* Adds support for multi-channel licenses. This allows each license to be assigned to more than one channel.

   With the introduction of multi-channel licenses, an installation error can occur if you use the `kots install` command without specifying a channel slug _and_ the license used to install does not have access to the Stable channel. For more information, see [Breaking Change](#breaking-changes-1-113-0) below.

### Bug Fixes {#bug-fixes-1-113-0}
* Fixes an issue in Embedded Cluster where going back to the Nodes page during the installation and then clicking continue did not work.

### Breaking Change {#breaking-changes-1-113-0}

In KOTS 1.113.0 and later, the following error will occur during installation if the `kots install` command lacks a channel slug _and_ the license does not have access to the Stable channel: `"failed to verify and update license: requested channel not found in latest license"`. This can break existing automation and documentation that includes a `kots install` command without a channel slug.

This error occurs because, when the channel slug is omitted from the `kots install` command (for example, `kots install app`), KOTS defaults to pulling metadata like the application icon and minimal RBAC configurations from the Stable channel. With the introduction of multi-channel licenses in KOTS 1.113.0, only licenses with access to a channel can pull metadata and download releases from that channel. This means that only licenses with access to the Stable channel can install without specifying the channel slug in the `kots install` command.

Previously, any license regardless of its assigned channel could install by excluding the channel slug from the `kots install` command. This could cause mismatches in deployment settings such as icons and minimal RBAC configurations because KOTS would pull metadata from the Stable channel and then install the release from the channel where the license was assigned.

**Solution:** To install a release from a channel other than Stable, specify the channel slug in the `kots install` command (for example, `kots install app/beta`). Also, ensure that the license has access to the specified channel. Refer to the Vendor Portal installation instructions or use the `replicated channel inspect CHANNEL_ID` command in the Replicated CLI for the correct commands.

To avoid breaking changes, update automation that uses the `kots install` command accordingly. Also, update documentation as needed so that the documented installation commands include the channel slug.

If you cannot update your KOTS installation command immediately, temporarily revert to KOTS 1.112.4 or earlier.

## 1.112.4

Released on July 31, 2024

Support for Kubernetes: 1.27, 1.28, 1.29, and 1.30

### Bug Fixes {#bug-fixes-1-112-4}
* Fixes an issue in Embedded Cluster upgrades where preflights did not rerun when the config was re-edited.
* Fixes an issue that caused K8s minor version parsing errors to be logged repeatedly.

Support for Kubernetes: 1.24, 1.25, 1.26 and 1.27

### Improvements {#improvements-1-100-1}
* Updates the way custom domains for the Replicated registry and proxy registry are used. If a default or channel-specific custom domain is configured, that custom domain is associated with a release when it is promoted to a channel. KOTS will rewrite images using that custom domain. The `replicatedRegistryDomain` and `proxyRegistryDomain` fields in the Application custom resource are deprecated but continue to work to give time to migrate to the new mechanism.

## 1.100.0

Released on May 26, 2023

Support for Kubernetes: 1.24, 1.25, 1.26 and 1.27

### New Features {#new-features-1-100-0}
* Adds support for `kots.io/creation-phase` and `kots.io/deletion-phase` annotations to control the order in which native Kubernetes resources are created and deleted, respectively. See [Deployment Phases](/vendor/orchestrating-resource-deployment#deployment-phases) in _Orchestrating Resource Deployment_.
* Adds support for a `kots.io/wait-for-ready` annotation, which causes KOTS to wait for a native Kubernetes resource to be ready before continuing with the deployment. See [Waiting for a Resource to be Ready](/vendor/orchestrating-resource-deployment#wait-for-a-resource-to-be-ready) in _Orchestrating Resource Deployment_.
* Adds support for a `kots.io/wait-for-properties` annotation, which causes KOTS to wait for one or more properties to match a desired value before continuing with the deployment. See [Wait for Resource Properties](/vendor/orchestrating-resource-deployment#wait-for-resource-properties) in _Orchestrating Resource Deployment_.

### Improvements {#improvements-1-100-0}

* Fixes an issue in embedded clusters where images from native Helm v2 (Beta) charts were incorrectly removed from the in-cluster registry, potentially leading to failed deployments.
* Bumps the Helm version used by KOTS to 3.12.0 to fix an issue where native Helm installations were failing on Kubernetes 1.27.

## 1.99.0

Released on May 18, 2023

Support for Kubernetes: 1.24, 1.25, and 1.26

### New Features {#new-features-1-99-0}
* Adds a new native Helm v2 installation method (Beta) that leverages the `kots.io/v1beta2` HelmChart custom resource. This v2 installation method does a Helm installation or upgrade of your Helm chart without modifying the chart with Kustomize. This is an improvement to the v1 installation method because it results in Helm installations that can be reproduced outside of the app manager, and it enables the use of additional Helm functionality that was not available in v1. See [HelmChart v2 (Beta)](/reference/custom-resource-helmchart-v2) in the _Custom Resources_ section.

### Improvements {#improvements-1-99-0}
* Applies application status informers before deploying the actual resources. This is helpful in cases where deployments take a long time, because the statuses are now available while the deployment happens.
* Updates the replicated/local-volume-provider image to v0.5.3 to resolve CVE-2022-4415 and CVE-2022-3821 with high severity.
* Replace the misleading call-to-action button on the instance snapshot restore modal, which could have mistakenly lead the user to believe the instance restore was initiated.
* Enhances formatting to accommodate lengthy strings for fields such as the application name and config item names.

### Bug Fixes {#bug-fixes-1-99-0}
* Fixes a bug where the rqlite collector was unable to collect a data dump if the name of the rqlite container changed.
* Fixes an issue where re-running preflights during the initial installation could cause the UI to incorrectly show a status of "Currently pending version".
* Fixes an issue where re-running preflights during the initial installation could cause the application to be re-deployed.

## 1.98.3

Released on May 5, 2023

Support for Kubernetes: 1.24, 1.25, and 1.26

### Improvements {#improvements-1-98-3}
* The JSON Web Token (JWT) is stored in an HttpOnly cookie to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
* The **Cluster Management** page shows by default the command for joining a primary node instead of a secondary node for high availability clusters.
* The resource status modal displays the time the data was last fetched automatically.
* Introduces a deterministic order for applying and deleting Kubernetes manifests based on the resource kind.
* Uses the [weight](https://docs.replicated.com/reference/custom-resource-helmchart#weight) field from the HelmChart custom resource to determine the order in which to uninstall charts that have `useHelmInstall: true`. Charts are uninstalled by weight in descending order, with higher weights uninstalled first.
* Application Helm charts are uninstalled first, then other Kubernetes manifests are uninstalled.
* Improvements to the **Version history** page include truncating long version labels, removing unnecessary preflight icons, and improving the content layout.
* The `kots admin-console push-images` command now returns an error if the provided air gap bundle file is missing.
* Adds a **Back** button to the **Preflights** page.

### Bug Fixes {#bug-fixes-1-98-3}
* Fixes an issue where snapshot restores hung if RabbitMQ cluster custom resources were used.
* Fixes an issue where Helm releases were not uninstalled when undeploying an application using the [kots remove](/reference/kots-cli-remove) command and passing the `--undeploy` flag.
* Fixes an issue where Helm charts that were deployed with native Helm to a different namespace than KOTS were not uninstalled when they were removed from subsequent application releases.
* Fixes an issue where uploading an air gap bundle through the admin console might have failed due to issues getting layers for OCI images.
* Fixes an issue where canceling a restore of an application (partial) snapshot sometimes did not work if multiple applications were installed in the same admin console.
* The **Config** page now shows the correct error message if errors other than regex validation occurred.
* Fixes an issue where the Config page incorrectly displayed "Edit the currently deployed config" when there was no application deployed.
* Fixes an issue where installations and upgrades could fail when checking if the cluster was a kURL cluster, if the user running the command was not authorized to list ConfigMaps in the `kube-system` namespace.
* Fixes an issue where air gapped application pods could fail to pull images from the kURL registry due to the image names being rewritten incorrectly, if the application was upgraded using the [`kots upstream upgrade`](/reference/kots-cli-upstream-upgrade) command.
* Fixes an issue where the **Version history** page could incorrectly show a **Deployed** button if an application version was deployed while preflight checks were running.

## 1.98.2

Released on April 26, 2023

Support for Kubernetes: 1.24, 1.25, and 1.26

### Bug Fixes {#bug-fixes-1-98-2}
* Fixes an issue where quotes were stripped from fields in HelmChart custom resources, which led to unexpected behavior and failed deployments.
* Fixes an issue where invalid Kustomize patches were generated for Helm charts with deeply nested dependencies.
* Fixes an issue where processing application manifests occasionally failed if null values were encountered after rendering.

## 1.98.1

Released on April 21, 2023

Support for Kubernetes: 1.24, 1.25, and 1.26

### Bug Fixes {#bug-fixes-1-98-1}
* Fixes an issue where multiple copies of the same Kubernetes resource (for example, the same `kind` and `name`) were deduplicated even if they had a different namespace. This deduplication resulted in the app manager deploying only one of the resources to the cluster.
* Fixes an issue that caused config updates to fail when the user did not provide a value for a required config item with a default value, even if the item was hidden.
* Fixes an issue where switching the license to a different channel did not fetch the current release on that channel if the number of releases was the same on both channels.

## 1.98.0

Released on April 19, 2023

Support for Kubernetes: 1.24, 1.25, and 1.26

### New Features {#new-features-1-98-0}
* Adds support for validating config items with type `text`, `textarea`, `password`, or `file` by matching the item's values against a regex pattern. For more information, see [validation](/reference/custom-resource-config#validation) in _Config_.
* Adds a new `kotsKinds` directory to the application archive that includes the rendered KOTS custom resources.

### Known Issue {#known-issues-1-95-0}

There is a known issue in the app manager v1.95.0 that causes application upgrades to fail for Helm charts that are deployed using the native Helm installation method. For more information about native Helm, see [How Replicated Deploys Helm Charts](/vendor/helm-overview#how-replicated-deploys-helm-charts) in _About Packaging with Helm_.

The upgrade failure occurs for a Helm chart when the following conditions are met:
- The Helm chart in the application has been installed previously using the app manager v1.94.2 or earlier.
- In the HelmChart custom resource for the Helm chart:
  - `useHelmInstall` is set to `true`. See [useHelmInstall](/reference/custom-resource-helmchart#usehelminstall) in _HelmChart_.
  - `namespace` is set to a value different than the namespace where the app manager is installed. See [namespace](/reference/custom-resource-helmchart#namespace) in _HelmChart_.

To avoid this known issue, Replicated recommends that you do not upgrade to v1.95.0. To work around this issue in v1.95.0, manually uninstall the affected Helm chart using the Helm CLI, and then redeploy the application using the app manager. See [Helm Uninstall](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_uninstall/) in the Helm documentation.

### New Features {#new-features-1-94-0}
* Updates the [kots velero configure-nfs](/reference/kots-cli-velero-configure-nfs) and [kots velero configure-hostpath](/reference/kots-cli-velero-configure-hostpath) commands to remove required manual steps and better automate the workflow. Users are now given a command to install Velero without a backup storage location. Then the user reruns the configure command to automatically configure the storage destination.
* Updates the [kots velero subcommands](/reference/kots-cli-velero-index) for configuring storage destinations, with instructions on how to install Velero if it is not yet installed.
* The instructions displayed in the admin console for configuring an NFS or host path snapshot storage destination no longer use the `kots velero print-fs-instructions` command. Instead they use the [kots velero configure-nfs](/reference/kots-cli-velero-configure-nfs) and [kots velero configure-hostpath](/reference/kots-cli-velero-configure-hostpath) commands to instruct the user to install Velero and configure the storage destination.

* Displays the `helm rollback` command when deploying previous revisions from the version history page in Helm-managed mode (Alpha). For more information about Helm-managed mode, see [Using Helm to Install an Application (Alpha)](/vendor/helm-install).

### Improvements {#improvements-1-80-0}
* Password complexity rules will now be shown when changing the password in the admin console.
* Updates Kustomize from 3.5.4 to 4.5.7. Note that Kustomize v4.5.7 does not allow duplicate YAML keys to be present in your application manifests, whereas v3.5.4 did. Kustomize v4.5.7 is a bit slower than v3.5.4, so fetching and deploying new versions takes a bit more time. Our benchmarking did not show this performance degradation to be significant. Updating Kustomize resolves several critical and high severity CVEs, and unblocks additional feature work in the app manager.

### Bug Fixes {#bug-fixes-1-80-0}
* Fixes an issue where an ambiguous error message was shown when the endpoint field was modified in the license.
* Fixes a bug that caused values from the HelmChart custom resource that did not use KOTS template functions to be rendered into the downloaded values.yaml file after updating the configuration in Helm-managed mode. For more information about Helm-managed mode, see [Using Helm to Install an Application (Alpha)](/vendor/helm-install).
* Fixes an issue in Helm-managed mode that caused an error when clicking the **Analyze application** button on the Troubleshoot page in the admin console for an application that did not include a support bundle specification. For more information about Helm-managed mode, see [Helm-managed mode (Alpha)](/vendor/helm-install). For more information about analyzing an application, see [Create a Support Bundle Using the Admin Console](/enterprise/troubleshooting-an-app#create-a-support-bundle-using-the-admin-console) in *Troubleshooting an Application*.

* CA certificates for snapshot storage endpoints can now be uploaded on the snapshot page of the admin console.
* User sessions expire after 12 hours of inactivity.
* Removes expired sessions from the store in a daily cleanup job.
* Adds a Beta option for vendors to exclude MinIO images from app manager air gap bundles from the download portal. For more information, see [ MinIO from Air Gap Bundles](/vendor/packaging-air-gap-excluding-minio) in the documentation.

* Fixes an issue where NFS snapshots could not be configured when MinIO is enabled in the cluster.
* Fixes an issue where updating the snapshot storage location to NFS or Host Path would incorrectly display a dialog indicating that Velero was not installed and configured properly.
* Fixes an issue that caused wrong metadata to be used at application install time when installing a specific version of an application with the `--app-version-label` flag.
* Fixes an issue that caused the support bundle analysis and/or redactions to not show up in the Troubleshoot page in the admin console in some cases.
* Fixes an issue where deployments weren't blocked when strict preflight analyzers failed due to parse/process errors.
* Fixes a style bug that caused the grid of metric graphs to be broken when there were more than three graphs.

Support for Kubernetes: 1.21, 1.22, and 1.23

### New Features
* Adds support for installing a specific application version. For more information about installing a specific application version, see [Online Installation in Existing Clusters](/enterprise/installing-existing-cluster and [Online Installation with the Kubernetes Installer](/enterprise/installing-embedded-cluster).
* Extends the ability of status informers to detect if the application is being updated.
* Adds the ability to provide a strict preflight, which cannot be skipped and must not have any failure outcomes. Any failure outcomes will prevent the user from deploying the application. For more information on strict preflights, see [Define KOTS Preflight Checks​](/vendor/preflight-kots-defining).
* New versions can automatically be deployed in the admin console, regardless of whether the vendor uses semantic versioning. For more information about automatically deploying new versions, see [Configure Automatic Updates​](/enterprise/updating-apps#configure-automatic-updates) in Updating an Application.

### Bug Fixes
* Fixes an issue that could cause images that are still used by the application to be deleted from the private registry in a Kubernetes installer-created cluster during image garbage collection.
* Fixes an issue where the same license could be installed more than once in some cases.
* Fixes an issue where the Cluster Management tab was not always initially present for Kubernetes installer-created clusters.
* Fixes an issue where attempting to re-download a pending application version would fail after upgrading the admin console from KOTS 1.65.

* Adds the ability to display the command to restore only the admin console from a [full snapshot](/enterprise/snapshots-understanding#full-snapshots-recommended) on the Full Snapshots page in the admin console.

### Improvements
* Adds the [`--no-port-forward`](/reference/kots-cli-install#usage) flag to the `kots install` command to disable automatic port-forwarding. The old `--port-forward` flag has been deprecated.

### Bug Fixes
* Corrects the placeholder Prometheus URL in the admin console dashboard so that it is accurate for embedded installations.
* Fixes a bug where the warning message sometimes printed incorrectly when a mismatch was detected between the kots CLI version and the version of the admin console that was running in the cluster.
* Fixes a bug where the **See details** button on the support bundle analysis page did not show any information about an unhealthy pod.
* Allows a user to re-upload a license if the application is not yet installed.

## 1.65.0

Released on February 25, 2022

Support for Kubernetes: 1.20, 1.21, 1.22, and 1.23

### New Features
* Permanently enables the redesigned admin console app dashboard and version history pages introduced in [KOTS 1.60.0](#1600).
* Application versions that fail to download now appear in the version history. A new button is also present with the version to allow the download to be retried. Previously, these failures were lost when a newer version was downloaded successfully.
* Introduces the [`kots upstream download`](../reference/kots-cli-upstream-download) command to retry downloading a failed update of the upstream application.

### Improvements
* The port-forward initiated to access the admin console will continually retry when it is disconnected. If a new kotsadm pod comes up, the port forward will switch and forward to the new pod.
* If the `kots` CLI version doesn't match the KOTS API version in the cluster, a warning message is displayed advising the user to update the `kots` CLI to the appropriate version.

### Bug Fixes
* Fixes uploading preflight results from the CLI.
* Fixes a bug where the app icon in the metadata would not show as the favicon in Google Chrome.

## 1.64.0

Released on February 18, 2022

### Improvements
* Sets the Native Helm timeout to 60 minutes instead of 5 minutes.

## 1.62.0

Released on February 4, 2022

Supported on Kubernetes: 1.20, 1.21, 1.22, and 1.23

### New Features
* Adds [`targetKotsVersion`](../reference/custom-resource-application#targetkotsversion) as a field in the application spec. This field allows you to set a target version of KOTS for a release. The initial installation of an application will fail if the currently installed KOTS version is greater than the target version. When a target version is set, end users will receive a notification in the admin console if their currently deployed version of KOTS is less than the target version. For more informaiton, see the documentation.

* Adds [`minKotsVersion`](../reference/custom-resource-application/#minkotsversion-beta) (Beta) as a field in the application spec. This allows you to specify the minimum supported KOTS version for a release. An application cannot be installed if the currently deployed KOTS version is less than the minimum KOTS version specified for a release. See the [`minKotsVersion` documentation](../reference/custom-resource-application/#minkotsversion-beta) for caveats since this is a Beta feature.

### Improvements
* Defaults [`kubectl kots get config --appslug`](../reference/kots-cli-get-config) to the app slug of the deployed application if there is only one in the namespace.
* Defaults [`kubectl kots get config --sequence`](../reference/kots-cli-get-config) to the sequence of the latest available version.

### Bug Fixes
