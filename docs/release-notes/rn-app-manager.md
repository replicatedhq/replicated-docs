## 1.70.1

Released on May 19, 2022

Support for Kubernetes: 1.21, 1.22, and 1.23

### Improvements
* When enabling GitOps, the initial commit properly translates all labeled secrets to SealedSecrets.
* Improves the application dashboard and version history pages when GitOps is enabled.

* Improves editing for scheduling automatic snapshots by making the cron expression input always visible.
* Adds a collector and analyzer for cases when NFS configuration fails because the `mount.nfs` binary is missing on the host.
* Cleans up failed `kotsadm-fs-minio-check` pods after the NFS backend for snapshots has been configured successfully.
* Supports Helm v3.8.2 in the app manager.
* Shows Helm installations when running in Helm managed mode (alpha).

### Bug Fixes

* Adds the ability to download `Config` file types for a given application sequence.
* Adds a template function `YamlEscape` to escape a string for inclusion in a YAML file.
* Adds the ability to allow uploading new TLS certificates used by kURL proxy with the [`reset-tls`](/reference/kots-cli-reset-tls) command.
* Adds the ability to dynamically set the number of results per page when browsing the application version history.

### Improvements
* When preflight checks are skipped during an initial installation, the application is still deployed.
* License and preflight errors are now displayed when performing an automated installation using the CLI.

### New Features
* Adds the ability to switch from a community license to a different license for the same application. See [Changing a Community License](../enterprise/updating-licenses#changing-a-community-license).

### Improvements
* The [ensure-secret](/reference/kots-cli-docker-ensure-secret) command now creates a new application version, based on the latest version, that adds the Docker Hub image pull secret to all Kubernetes manifests that have images. This avoids Docker Hub's rate limiting.
* CA certificates for snapshot storage endpoints can now be uploaded on the snapshot page of the admin console.
* User sessions expire after 12 hours of inactivity.
* Removes expired sessions from the store in a daily cleanup job.
* Adds a Beta option for vendors to exclude MinIO images from app manager air gap bundles from the download portal. For more information, see [ MinIO from Air Gap Bundles](/vendor/packaging-air-gap-excluding-minio) in the documentation.

Released on April 4, 2022

Support for Kubernetes: 1.21, 1.22, and 1.23

### New Features
* Adds the ability to make a KOTS application version required. Required version cannot be skipped during upgrades. See [Promoting releases](../vendor/releases-promoting).
* Adds the `supportMinimalRBACPrivileges` field to the Application custom resource, and adds the `--use-minimal-rbac` flag to the `kots install` command. `supportMinimalRBACPrivileges` indicates that the application supports minimal RBAC, but it will not be used unless the `--use-minimal-rbac` flag is passed to the `kots install` command.

* Displays on the cluster management page of the admin console the labels applied to nodes in a Kubernetes installer-created cluster.
* The default Troubleshoot analyzers will now specifically call out issues with Envoy/Contour if detected.

### Bug Fixes
* Fixes a bug with automatic updates where new versions would be deployed automatically regardless of preflight outcomes. When automatic updates are configured, new versions will now only be deployed automatically if the preflights succeed.
* Fixes an issue where NFS snapshots could not be configured when MinIO is enabled in the cluster.
* Fixes an issue where updating the snapshot storage location to NFS or Host Path would incorrectly display a dialog indicating that Velero was not installed and configured properly.
* Fixes an issue that caused wrong metadata to be used at application install time when installing a specific version of an application with the `--app-version-label` flag.
* Fixes an issue that caused the support bundle analysis and/or redactions to not show up in the Troubleshoot page in the admin console in some cases.
* Fixes an issue where deployments weren't blocked when strict preflight analyzers failed due to parse/process errors.
* Fixes a style bug that caused the grid of metric graphs to be broken when there were more than three graphs.
* Fixes an issue on the config editor page that caused an element to be hidden under the navbar when the corresponding config item was clicked on from the sidebar.
* Fixes an issue where a version that was pulled in via automatic checks and deployed via automatic deployments would not be properly updated on the dashboard version card.
* Fixes an issue where two versions could show as being currently deployed on the version history page when using automatic deployments.
* Fixes an issue where AWS IAM instance roles could not be used when configuring the snapshot storage destination.

## 1.67.0

Released on March 21, 2022

Support for Kubernetes: 1.21, 1.22, and 1.23

### New Features
* Adds support for installing a specific application version. For more information about installing a specific application version, see [Installing in an Online (Internet-connected) Environment](/enterprise/installing-existing-cluster-online) and [Installing with the Kubernetes Installer](/enterprise/installing-embedded-cluster).
* Extends the ability of status informers to detect if the application is being updated.
* Adds the ability to provide a strict preflight, which cannot be skipped and must not have any failure outcomes. Any failure outcomes will prevent the user from deploying the application. For more information on strict preflights, see [About preflight checks and support bundles​](/vendor/preflight-support-bundle-creating#about-preflight-checks-and-support-bundles) in Creating Preflight Checks and Support Bundles.
* New versions can automatically be deployed in the admin console, regardless of whether the vendor uses semantic versioning. For more information about automatically deploying new versions, see [Configure Automatic Updates​](/enterprise/updating-apps#configure-automatic-updates) in Updating an Application.

### Bug Fixes
* Fixes an issue that could cause images that are still used by the application to be deleted from the private registry in a Kubernetes installer-created cluster during image garbage collection.
* Fixes an issue where the same license could be installed more than once in some cases.
* Fixes an issue where the Cluster Management tab was not always initially present for Kubernetes installer-created clusters.
* Fixes an issue where attempting to re-download a pending application version would fail after upgrading the admin console from KOTS 1.65.
* Fixes an issue where the application icon in the metadata did not show as the favicon on the TLS pages.

## 1.66.0

Released on March 8, 2022

Support for Kubernetes: 1.21, 1.22, and 1.23

### New Features
* Adds the ability to exclude the applications or the admin console from full snapshot restores using the [`kots restore`](/reference/kots-cli-restore-index) command.
* Adds the ability to display the command to restore only the admin console from a [full snapshot](/enterprise/snapshots-understanding#full-snapshots-recommended) on the Full Snapshots page in the admin console.

### Improvements
* Adds the [`--no-port-forward`](/reference/kots-cli-install#usage) flag to the `kots install` command to disable automatic port-forwarding. The old `--port-forward` flag has been deprecated.

### Bug Fixes
* Corrects the placeholder Prometheus URL in the admin console dashboard so that it is accurate for embedded installations.
* Fixes a bug where the warning message sometimes printed incorrectly when a mismatch was detected between the kots CLI version and the version of the admin console that was running in the cluster.
* Fixes a bug where the **See details** button on the support bundle analysis page did not show any information about an unhealthy pod.
* Allows a user to re-upload a license if the application is not yet installed.
* Allows GitOps to be disabled when it is enabled but has an invalid configuration. Previously, you were required to fix the configuration before disabling GitOps.

## 1.65.0

Released on February 25, 2022

Support for Kubernetes: 1.20, 1.21, 1.22, and 1.23

### New Features
* Permanently enables the redesigned admin console app dashboard and version history pages introduced in [KOTS 1.60.0](#1600).
* Application versions that fail to download now appear in the version history. A new button is also present with the version to allow the download to be retried. Previously, these failures were lost when a newer version was downloaded successfully.
* Introduces the [`kots upstream download`](../reference/kots-cli-upstream-download) command to retry downloading a failed update of the upstream application.

### Improvements
* The port-forward initiated to access the admin console will continually retry when it is disconnected. If a new kotsadm pod comes up, the port forward will switch and forward to the new pod.
* If the `kots` CLI version doesn't match the KOTS API version in the cluster, a warning message is displayed advising the user to update the `kots` CLI to the appropriate version.

### Bug Fixes
* Fixes uploading preflight results from the CLI.
* Fixes a bug where the app icon in the metadata would not show as the favicon in Google Chrome.

## 1.64.0

Released on February 18, 2022

Support for Kubernetes: 1.20, 1.21, 1.22, and 1.23

### Improvements

## 1.62.0

Released on February 4, 2022

Supported on Kubernetes: 1.20, 1.21, 1.22, and 1.23

### New Features
* Adds [`targetKotsVersion`](../reference/custom-resource-application#targetkotsversion) as a field in the application spec. This field allows you to set a target version of KOTS for a release. The initial installation of an application will fail if the currently installed KOTS version is greater than the target version. When a target version is set, end users will receive a notification in the admin console if their currently deployed version of KOTS is less than the target version. For more informaiton, see the documentation.

* Adds [`minKotsVersion`](../reference/custom-resource-application/#minkotsversion-beta) (Beta) as a field in the application spec. This allows you to specify the minimum supported KOTS version for a release. An application cannot be installed if the currently deployed KOTS version is less than the minimum KOTS version specified for a release. See the [`minKotsVersion` documentation](../reference/custom-resource-application/#minkotsversion-beta) for caveats since this is a Beta feature.

### Improvements
* Defaults [`kubectl kots get config --appslug`](../reference/kots-cli-get-config) to the app slug of the deployed application if there is only one in the namespace.
* Defaults [`kubectl kots get config --sequence`](../reference/kots-cli-get-config) to the sequence of the latest available version.

### Bug Fixes
* Fixes a bug that caused the "Details" link, which shows the [application status](../vendor/admin-console-display-app-status), to be not visible in the new dashboard UI.
* Fixes the omission of certain password values from the rendered YAML file when using [`kubectl kots pull`](../reference/kots-cli-get-config).
* Fixes an issue that caused the license file included in a support bundle to contain a long array of integers instead of a string in the signature field.
* Fixes an issue which caused setting up a host path as a snapshot storage destination to fail.

## 1.61.0

Released on February 1, 2022

Supported on Kubernetes: 1.20, 1.21, 1.22, and 1.23

* Adds a CLI command to [get all available versions for an application](../reference/kots-cli-get-versions) from the app manager.
* Adds the ability to block installing or upgrading an application if the current KOTS version is incompatible with the KOTS version required by the application. This feature is experimental and is only available to vendors who have requested access.

### Bug Fixes
* Fixes a bug that caused images to be pushed to a private registry multiple times during an air gap installation.
* Fixes a bug that erroneously displays a message to edit the current config when performing a new installation.
* Fixes an issue that caused [image garbage collection](../enterprise/image-registry-embedded-cluster#enable-and-disable-image-garbage-collection) to only remove images with the "latest" tag.

## 1.60.0

Released on January 25, 2022

Supported on Kubernetes: 1.20, 1.21, and 1.22
