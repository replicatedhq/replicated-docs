:::

## 1.66.0

Released on March 8, 2022

Support for Kubernetes: 1.21, 1.22, and 1.23

### New Features
* Adds the ability to exclude the applications or the admin console from full snapshot restores using the [`kots restore`](/reference/kots-cli-restore-index) command.
* Adds the ability to display the command to restore only the admin console from a [full snapshot](/enterprise/snapshots-understanding#full-snapshots-recommended) on the Full Snapshots page in the admin console.

### Improvements
* Adds the [`--no-port-forward`](/reference/kots-cli-install#usage) flag to the `kots install` command to disable automatic port-forwarding. The old `--port-forward` flag has been deprecated.

### Bug Fixes
* Corrects the placeholder Prometheus URL in the admin console dashboard so that it is accurate for embedded installations.
* Fixes a bug where the warning message sometimes printed incorrectly when a mismatch was detected between the kots CLI version and the version of the admin console that was running in the cluster.
* Fixes a bug where the **See details** button on the support bundle analysis page did not show any information about an unhealthy pod.
* Allows a user to re-upload a license if the application is not yet installed.
* Allows GitOps to be disabled when it is enabled but has an invalid configuration. Previously, you were required to fix the configuration before disabling GitOps.

## 1.65.0

Released on February 25, 2022

Support for Kubernetes: 1.20, 1.21, 1.22, and 1.23

### New Features
* Permanently enables the redesigned admin console app dashboard and version history pages introduced in [KOTS 1.60.0](#1600).
* Application versions that fail to download now appear in the version history. A new button is also present with the version to allow the download to be retried. Previously, these failures were lost when a newer version was downloaded successfully.
* Introduces the [`kots upstream download`](../reference/kots-cli-upstream-download) command to retry downloading a failed update of the upstream application.

### Improvements
* The port-forward initiated to access the admin console will continually retry when it is disconnected. If a new kotsadm pod comes up, the port forward will switch and forward to the new pod.
* If the `kots` CLI version doesn't match the KOTS API version in the cluster, a warning message is displayed advising the user to update the `kots` CLI to the appropriate version.

### Bug Fixes
* Fixes uploading preflight results from the CLI.
* Fixes a bug where the app icon in the metadata would not show as the favicon in Google Chrome.

## 1.64.0

Released on February 18, 2022

Support for Kubernetes: 1.20, 1.21, 1.22, and 1.23

### Improvements
* A MinIO image will no longer be present in new deployments when MinIO is not specified as an add-on in the Kubernetes installer specification.
* Enables an alternative that does not use MinIO for `hostPath` snapshots if the MinIO image is not present on the instance.

### Bug Fixes
* Fixes a bug that showed an incorrect diff on the version history page.
* Fixes deploy log errors for PVCs when using OpenEBS with Kubernetes 1.19 through 1.21.

## 1.63.0

Released on February 11, 2022

Supported on Kubernetes: 1.20, 1.21, 1.22, and 1.23

### New Features
* Changes the [`kots upstream upgrade`](../reference/kots-cli-upstream-upgrade) command to be synchronous by default and exposes error messages for it.

### Improvements
* Sets the Native Helm timeout to 60 minutes instead of 5 minutes.

## 1.62.0

Released on February 4, 2022

Supported on Kubernetes: 1.20, 1.21, 1.22, and 1.23

### New Features
* Adds [`targetKotsVersion`](../reference/custom-resource-application#targetkotsversion) as a field in the application spec. This field allows you to set a target version of KOTS for a release. The initial installation of an application will fail if the currently installed KOTS version is greater than the target version. When a target version is set, end users will receive a notification in the admin console if their currently deployed version of KOTS is less than the target version. For more informaiton, see the documentation.

* Adds [`minKotsVersion`](../reference/custom-resource-application/#minkotsversion-beta) (Beta) as a field in the application spec. This allows you to specify the minimum supported KOTS version for a release. An application cannot be installed if the currently deployed KOTS version is less than the minimum KOTS version specified for a release. See the [`minKotsVersion` documentation](../reference/custom-resource-application/#minkotsversion-beta) for caveats since this is a Beta feature.

### Improvements
* Defaults [`kubectl kots get config --appslug`](../reference/kots-cli-get-config) to the app slug of the deployed application if there is only one in the namespace.
* Defaults [`kubectl kots get config --sequence`](../reference/kots-cli-get-config) to the sequence of the latest available version.

### Bug Fixes
* Fixes a bug that caused the "Details" link, which shows the [application status](../vendor/admin-console-display-app-status), to be not visible in the new dashboard UI.
* Fixes the omission of certain password values from the rendered YAML file when using [`kubectl kots pull`](../reference/kots-cli-get-config).
* Fixes an issue that caused the license file included in a support bundle to contain a long array of integers instead of a string in the signature field.
* Fixes an issue which caused setting up a host path as a snapshot storage destination to fail.

## 1.61.0

Released on February 1, 2022

Supported on Kubernetes: 1.20, 1.21, 1.22, and 1.23

### New Features
* Adds a CLI command to [get all available versions for an application](../reference/kots-cli-get-versions) from the app manager.
* Adds the ability to block installing or upgrading an application if the current KOTS version is incompatible with the KOTS version required by the application. This feature is experimental and is only available to vendors who have requested access.

### Bug Fixes
* Fixes a bug that caused images to be pushed to a private registry multiple times during an air gap installation.
* Fixes a bug that erroneously displays a message to edit the current config when performing a new installation.
* Fixes an issue that caused [image garbage collection](../enterprise/image-registry-embedded-cluster#enable-and-disable-image-garbage-collection) to only remove images with the "latest" tag.

## 1.60.0

Released on January 25, 2022

Supported on Kubernetes: 1.20, 1.21, and 1.22

### New Features
* The admin console app dashboard and version history pages have been redesigned! This redesign improves the aesthetics of these pages and brings key functionality directly to the app dashboard.

### Improvements
* Updates MinIO to RELEASE.2022-01-08T03-11-54Z (resolves CVE-2021-43858 CVE).
* Updates Postgres to version 10.19.

### Bug Fixes
* Fixes an issue that caused images to be pushed multiple times during an [airgap installation](../enterprise/installing-existing-cluster-airgapped#upload-the-airgap-bundle) when the [Native Helm](../vendor/helm-processing/#native-helm) feature is enabled.
* Fixes an issue that prevented the deployment status labels from breaking into multiple lines on small displays.

## 1.59.3

Released on January 21, 2022

### Improvements

### New Features
* Adds the `kubectl kots get config` command to export config values. This includes a `--decrypt` flag to decrypt sensitive values.
* The internal storage location for snapshots now uses a persistent volume instead of object storage when the `disableS3` flag is set to `true` for embedded clusters. For more information about removing KOTS use of object storage, see the [kURL add-on documentation](https://kurl.sh/docs/add-ons/kotsadm).

### Improvements
* Adds version output for current and new releases to the [`upstream upgrade`](../reference/kots-cli-upstream-upgrade) CLI command.

### Bug Fixes
* Fixes a bug that caused analyzers to surface errors in namespaces not used by the application when the admin console has cluster access in existing cluster installations.
* Fixes an issue that caused image pull secrets to be rendered in the admin console namespace instead of the `namespace` specified in the kots.io/v1beta1.HelmChart when using `useHelmInstall`.
* Fixes the `kots pull` CLI command to properly inject `imagePullSecrets` when using Helm Charts with `useHelmInstall` set to `true`.
* Fixes a bug that causes application images to not be deleted from a [private registry](../enterprise/image-registry-embedded-cluster).
* Fixes a bug that causes images included in support bundle's [`run` collector](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/collect/run/#image-required) to not be deleted from a private registry.
