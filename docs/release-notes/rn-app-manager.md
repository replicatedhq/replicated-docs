# App Manager Release Notes

## 1.94.0

Released on February 7, 2023

Support for Kubernetes: 1.23, 1.24, 1.25, and 1.26

### New Features {#new-features-1-94-0}
* Updates the [kots velero configure-nfs](/reference/kots-cli-velero-configure-nfs) and [kots velero configure-hostpath](/reference/kots-cli-velero-configure-hostpath) commands to remove required manual steps and better automate the workflow. Users are now given a command to install Velero without a backup storage location. Then the user reruns the configure command to automatically configure the storage destination.
* Updates the [kots velero subcommands](/reference/kots-cli-velero-index) for configuring storage destinations, with instructions on how to install Velero if it is not yet installed.
* The instructions displayed in the admin console for configuring an NFS or host path snapshot storage destination no longer use the `kots velero print-fs-instructions` command. Instead they use the [kots velero configure-nfs](/reference/kots-cli-velero-configure-nfs) and [kots velero configure-hostpath](/reference/kots-cli-velero-configure-hostpath) commands to instruct the user to install Velero and configure the storage destination.

## 1.81.0

Released on August 12, 2022

Support for Kubernetes: 1.21, 1.22, 1.23, and 1.24

### New Features {#new-features-1-81-0}
* Adds support for the `alias` field in Helm chart dependencies.
* Adds support for image tags and digests to be used together for most online installations. For more information, see [Support for Image Tags and Digests](/vendor/packaging-private-images#support-for-image-tags-and-digests) in *Connecting to an Image Registry*.

Support for Helm v2, including security patches, ended on November 13, 2020, and support for Helm v2 in the app manager will be removed in the near future. For more information about the HelmChart custom resource, see [HelmChart](/reference/custom-resource-helmchart).
* Improves the UI responsiveness on the Config page.

### Bug Fixes {#bug-fixes-1-81-0}
* Fixes an issuse where the license tab did not show for Helm-managed installations.
* Fixes an issue that could cause `Namespace` manifests packaged in Helm charts to be excluded from deployment, causing namespaces to not be created when `useHelmInstall` is set to `true` and `namespace` is an empty string. For more information about these fields, see [useHelmInstall](/reference/custom-resource-helmchart#usehelminstall) and [namespace](/reference/custom-resource-helmchart#usehelminstall) in *HelmChart*.

## 1.80.0

Released on August 8, 2022

Support for Kubernetes: 1.21, 1.22, 1.23, and 1.24

### New Features {#new-features-1-80-0}
* Displays the `helm rollback` command when deploying previous revisions from the version history page in Helm-managed mode (Alpha). For more information about Helm-managed mode, see [Using Helm to Install an Application (Alpha)](/vendor/helm-install).

### Improvements {#improvements-1-80-0}
* Password complexity rules will now be shown when changing the password in the admin console.
* Updates Kustomize from 3.5.4 to 4.5.7. Note that Kustomize v4.5.7 does not allow duplicate YAML keys to be present in your application manifests, whereas v3.5.4 did. Kustomize v4.5.7 is a bit slower than v3.5.4, so fetching and deploying new versions takes a bit more time. Our benchmarking did not show this performance degradation to be significant. Updating Kustomize resolves several critical and high severity CVEs, and unblocks additional feature work in the app manager.

### Bug Fixes {#bug-fixes-1-80-0}
* Fixes an issue where an ambiguous error message was shown when the endpoint field was modified in the license.
* Fixes a bug that caused values from the HelmChart custom resource that did not use Replicated template functions to be rendered into the downloaded values.yaml file after updating the configuration in Helm-managed mode. For more information about Helm-managed mode, see [Using Helm to Install an Application (Alpha)](/vendor/helm-install).
* Fixes an issue in Helm-managed mode that caused an error when clicking the **Analyze application** button on the Troubleshoot page in the admin console for an application that did not include a support bundle specification. For more information about Helm-managed mode, see [Helm-managed mode (Alpha)](/vendor/helm-install). For more information about analyzing an application, see [Create a Support Bundle Using the Admin Console](/enterprise/troubleshooting-an-app#create-a-support-bundle-using-the-admin-console) in *Troubleshooting an Application*.

* CA certificates for snapshot storage endpoints can now be uploaded on the snapshot page of the admin console.
* User sessions expire after 12 hours of inactivity.
* Removes expired sessions from the store in a daily cleanup job.
* Adds a Beta option for vendors to exclude MinIO images from app manager air gap bundles from the download portal. For more information, see [ MinIO from Air Gap Bundles](/vendor/packaging-air-gap-excluding-minio) in the documentation.

For more information on strict preflights, see [About preflight checks and support bundles​](/vendor/preflight-support-bundle-creating#about-preflight-checks-and-support-bundles) in Creating Preflight Checks and Support Bundles.
* New versions can automatically be deployed in the admin console, regardless of whether the vendor uses semantic versioning. For more information about automatically deploying new versions, see [Configure Automatic Updates​](/enterprise/updating-apps#configure-automatic-updates) in Updating an Application.

### Bug Fixes
* Fixes an issue that could cause images that are still used by the application to be deleted from the private registry in a Kubernetes installer-created cluster during image garbage collection.
* Fixes an issue where the same license could be installed more than once in some cases.

* Adds the [`--no-port-forward`](/reference/kots-cli-install#usage) flag to the `kots install` command to disable automatic port-forwarding. The old `--port-forward` flag has been deprecated.

### Bug Fixes
* Corrects the placeholder Prometheus URL in the admin console dashboard so that it is accurate for embedded installations.
* Fixes a bug where the warning message sometimes printed incorrectly when a mismatch was detected between the kots CLI version and the version of the admin console that was running in the cluster.
* Fixes a bug where the **See details** button on the support bundle analysis page did not show any information about an unhealthy pod.
* Allows a user to re-upload a license if the application is not yet installed.
* Allows GitOps to be disabled when it is enabled but has an invalid configuration. Previously, you were required to fix the configuration before disabling GitOps.

## 1.65.0

Released on February 25, 2022

Support for Kubernetes: 1.20, 1.21, 1.22, and 1.23

### New Features
* Permanently enables the redesigned admin console app dashboard and version history pages introduced in [KOTS 1.60.0](#1600).
* Application versions that fail to download now appear in the version history. A new button is also present with the version to allow the download to be retried. Previously, these failures were lost when a newer version was downloaded successfully.
* Introduces the [`kots upstream download`](../reference/kots-cli-upstream-download) command to retry downloading a failed update of the upstream application.

### Improvements
* The port-forward initiated to access the admin console will continually retry when it is disconnected. If a new kotsadm pod comes up, the port forward will switch and forward to the new pod.
* If the `kots` CLI version doesn't match the KOTS API version in the cluster, a warning message is displayed advising the user to update the `kots` CLI to the appropriate version.

### Bug Fixes
* Fixes uploading preflight results from the CLI.
* Fixes a bug where the app icon in the metadata would not show as the favicon in Google Chrome.

## 1.64.0

Released on February 18, 2022

Support for Kubernetes: 1.20, 1.21, 1.22, and 1.23

* Fixes deploy log errors for PVCs when using OpenEBS with Kubernetes 1.19 through 1.21.

## 1.63.0

Released on February 11, 2022

Supported on Kubernetes: 1.20, 1.21, 1.22, and 1.23

### New Features

### Improvements
* Sets the Native Helm timeout to 60 minutes instead of 5 minutes.

## 1.62.0

Released on February 4, 2022

Supported on Kubernetes: 1.20, 1.21, 1.22, and 1.23

### New Features
* Adds [`targetKotsVersion`](../reference/custom-resource-application#targetkotsversion) as a field in the application spec. This field allows you to set a target version of KOTS for a release. The initial installation of an application will fail if the currently installed KOTS version is greater than the target version. When a target version is set, end users will receive a notification in the admin console if their currently deployed version of KOTS is less than the target version. For more informaiton, see the documentation.

* Adds [`minKotsVersion`](../reference/custom-resource-application/#minkotsversion-beta) (Beta) as a field in the application spec. This allows you to specify the minimum supported KOTS version for a release. An application cannot be installed if the currently deployed KOTS version is less than the minimum KOTS version specified for a release. See the [`minKotsVersion` documentation](../reference/custom-resource-application/#minkotsversion-beta) for caveats since this is a Beta feature.

### Improvements
* Defaults [`kubectl kots get config --appslug`](../reference/kots-cli-get-config) to the app slug of the deployed application if there is only one in the namespace.
* Defaults [`kubectl kots get config --sequence`](../reference/kots-cli-get-config) to the sequence of the latest available version.

### Bug Fixes
* Fixes a bug that caused the "Details" link, which shows the [application status](../vendor/admin-console-display-app-status), to be not visible in the new dashboard UI.
* Fixes the omission of certain password values from the rendered YAML file when using [`kubectl kots pull`](../reference/kots-cli-get-config).
* Fixes an issue that caused the license file included in a support bundle to contain a long array of integers instead of a string in the signature field.
* Fixes an issue which caused setting up a host path as a snapshot storage destination to fail.

## 1.61.0

Released on February 1, 2022

Supported on Kubernetes: 1.20, 1.21, 1.22, and 1.23

* Adds a CLI command to [get all available versions for an application](../reference/kots-cli-get-versions) from the app manager.
* Adds the ability to block installing or upgrading an application if the current KOTS version is incompatible with the KOTS version required by the application. This feature is experimental and is only available to vendors who have requested access.

### Bug Fixes
* Fixes a bug that caused images to be pushed to a private registry multiple times during an air gap installation.
* Fixes a bug that erroneously displays a message to edit the current config when performing a new installation.
* Fixes an issue that caused [image garbage collection](../enterprise/image-registry-embedded-cluster#enable-and-disable-image-garbage-collection) to only remove images with the "latest" tag.

For more information about removing KOTS use of object storage, see the [kURL add-on documentation](https://kurl.sh/docs/add-ons/kotsadm).

### Improvements
* Adds version output for current and new releases to the [`upstream upgrade`](../reference/kots-cli-upstream-upgrade) CLI command.

### Bug Fixes
* Fixes a bug that caused analyzers to surface errors in namespaces not used by the application when the admin console has cluster access in existing cluster installations.
* Fixes an issue that caused image pull secrets to be rendered in the admin console namespace instead of the `namespace` specified in the kots.io/v1beta1.HelmChart when using `useHelmInstall`.
