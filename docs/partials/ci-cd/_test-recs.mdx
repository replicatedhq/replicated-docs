* **Application Testing:** Traditional application testing includes unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. These tests are critical for application reliability, and CMX is designed to to incorporate and use your application testing.

* **Performance Testing:** Performance testing is used to benchmark your application to ensure it can handle the expected load and scale gracefully. Test your application under a range of workloads and scenarios to identify any bottlenecks or performance issues. Make sure to optimize your application for different Kubernetes distributions and configurations by creating all of the environments you need to test in.

* **Smoke Testing:** Using a single, conformant Kubernetes distribution to test basic functionality of your application with default (or standard) configuration values is a quick way to get feedback if something is likely to be broken for all or most customers. Replicated also recommends that you include each Kubernetes version that you intend to support in your smoke tests.

* **Compatibility Testing:** Because applications run on various Kubernetes distributions and configurations, it is important to test compatibility across different environments. CMX provides this infrastructure.

* **Canary Testing:** Before releasing to all customers, consider deploying your application to a small subset of your customer base as a _canary_ release. This lets you monitor the application's performance and stability in real-world environments, while minimizing the impact of potential issues. CMX enables canary testing by simulating exact (or near) customer environments and configurations to test your application with.
