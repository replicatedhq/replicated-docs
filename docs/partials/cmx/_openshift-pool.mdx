:::note
Due to the time it takes to start an OpenShift cluster, a warm pool of OpenShift clusters is maintained. When available, an OpenShift cluster from the pool starts in less than one minute.

OpenShift clusters from the pool are limited to the default specifications using the CLI: r1.large instance type and 50 GiB disk.
