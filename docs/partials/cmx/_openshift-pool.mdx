:::note
Due to the time it takes to start an OpenShift cluster, a warm pool of OpenShift clusters is maintained.
When available, an OpenShift cluster from the pool starts in approximately two minutes with default disks.
When starting a cluster with disk size different than the default, an additional 4 minutes is added to warm cluster start time.
