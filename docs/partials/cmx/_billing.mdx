Clusters created with the compatiblity matrix are billed by the minute. Per-minute billing begins when the cluster reaches a Running state and ends when the cluster is deleted. The compatibility matrix marks a cluster as Running when a working kubeconfig for the cluster is accessible.

You are billed only for the time that the cluster is in a Running state. You are _not_ billed for the time that it takes the compatibility matrix to create and tear down clusters, including when the cluster is in an Assigned state.

To create clusters with the compatibility matrix, you must have credits in your vendor portal account. 
To request credits, log in to the vendor portal and go to [**Compatibility Matrix > Request more credits**](https://vendor.replicated.com/compatibility-matrix).
