Clusters created with Compatibility Matrix are billed by the minute. Per-minute billing begins when the cluster reaches a `running` status and ends when the cluster is deleted. Compatibility Matrix marks a cluster as `running` when a working kubeconfig for the cluster is accessible.

You are billed only for the time that the cluster is in a `running` status. You are _not_ billed for the time that it takes Compatibility Matrix to create and tear down clusters, including when the cluster is in an `assigned` status.
