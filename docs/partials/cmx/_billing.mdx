Clusters created with the compatiblity matrix are billed by the minute. Per-minute billing begins when the cluster reaches a `running` status and ends when the cluster is deleted. The compatibility matrix marks a cluster as `running` when a working kubeconfig for the cluster is accessible.

You are billed only for the time that the cluster is in a `running` status. You are _not_ billed for the time that it takes the compatibility matrix to create and tear down clusters, including when the cluster is in an `assigned` status.

To create clusters with the compatibility matrix, you must have credits in your vendor portal account. 
To request credits, log in to the vendor portal and go to [**Compatibility Matrix > Request more credits**](https://vendor.replicated.com/compatibility-matrix).
