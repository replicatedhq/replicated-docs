The Replicated compatibility matrix quickly provisions ephemeral clusters of different Kubernetes distributions and versions, such as OpenShift, EKS, and Replicated kURL.

You can use the compatibility matrix to get kubectl access to running clusters within minutes or less. This allows you to more easily test your code in a range of different environments before releasing to customers.

Example use cases for the compatiblity matrix include:
* Run tests before releasing a new version of your application to validate compatibility with supported Kubernetes distributions
* Get access to a cluster to develop on and quickly test changes
* Reproduce a reported issue on a customer-representative environment for troubleshooting
