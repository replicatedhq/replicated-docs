The compatibility matrix can create clusters on virtual machines (VMs), such as kind, k3s, and Red Hat OpenShift OKD, and also create cloud-managed clusters, such as EKS and GKE:

* Cloud-based Kubernetes distributions are run in a Replicated managed and controlled cloud account to optimize and deliver a clusters quickly and reliably. The Replicated account has control planes ready and adds a node group when you request it, making the cluster available much faster than if you try to create your own cluster with your own cloud account.

* VMs run on Replicated bare metal servers located in several data centers, including data centers physically in the European Union.

To get the most up-to-date list of support types of clusters, you can run `replicated cluster versions`. For command usage, see [cluster versions](/reference/replicated-cli-cluster-versions).

For more detailed information about the supported clusters and versions, see [Supported Compatibility Matrix Cluster Types (Beta)](testing-supported-clusters).
