Typical Embedded Cluster workflows, like updating the application and the cluster, can be done through the KOTS Admin Console. It is also possible to access an embedded cluster from the CLI if necessary, such as for troubleshooting.

To access the cluster and use other included binaries:

1. SSH onto a controller node.

1. Use the Embedded Cluster shell command to start a shell with access to the cluster:

     ```bash
     sudo ./APP_SLUG shell
     ```

     The output looks similar to the following:

     ```bash
            __4___
        _  \ \ \ \   Welcome to APP_SLUG debug shell.
        <'\ /_/_/_/   This terminal is now configured to access your cluster.
        ((____!___/) Type 'exit' (or CTRL+d) to exit.

        root@alex-ec-2:/home/alex# export PATH="$PATH:/var/lib/embedded-cluster/bin"
        root@alex-ec-2:/home/alex# source <(kubectl completion bash)
        root@alex-ec-2:/home/alex# source /etc/bash_completion
    ```

    The appropriate kubeconfig is exported, and the location of useful binaries like kubectl and Replicated’s preflight and support-bundle plugins is added to PATH.

    :::note
    The shell command cannot be run on non-controller nodes.

1. Use the available binaries as needed.

     **Example**:

     ```bash
     kubectl version
     ```
     ```
     Client Version: v1.29.1
     Kustomize Version: v5.0.4-0.20230601165947-6ce0bf390ce3
     Server Version: v1.29.1+k0s
     ```

1. Type `exit` or **Ctrl + D** to exit the shell.
