To access the cluster and use other included binaries:

1. SSH onto a controller node.

     :::note
     You cannot run the `shell` command on worker nodes.
     :::

1. Use the Embedded Cluster shell command to start a shell with access to the cluster:

     ```
     sudo ./APP_SLUG shell
     ```
     Where `APP_SLUG` is the unique slug for the application.

     The output looks similar to the following:
     ```
        __4___
     _  \ \ \ \   Welcome to APP_SLUG debug shell.
    <'\ /_/_/_/   This terminal is now configured to access your cluster.
     ((____!___/) Type 'exit' (or CTRL+d) to exit.

    ```

     The appropriate kubeconfig is exported, and the location of useful binaries like kubectl and Replicatedâ€™s preflight and support-bundle plugins is added to PATH.

1. Use the available binaries as needed.

     **Example**:

     ```bash
     kubectl version
     ```
     ```
     Client Version: v1.29.1
     Kustomize Version: v5.0.4-0.20230601165947-6ce0bf390ce3
     Server Version: v1.29.1+k0s
     ```

1. Type `exit` or **Ctrl + D** to exit the shell.
