1. On a machine with browser access (for example, where you accessed the Admin Console to configure the application), download the air gap bundle for the new version using the same curl command that you used to install. For example:

   ```bash
    curl https://replicated.app/embedded/APP_SLUG/CHANNEL_SLUG?airgap=true -H "Authorization: LICENSE_ID" -o 	APP_SLUG-CHANNEL_SLUG.tgz
   ```
   For more information, see [Install](/enterprise/installing-embedded-air-gap#install).

1. Untar the tarball. For example:

   ```bash
   tar -xvzf APP_SLUG-CHANNEL_SLUG.tgz
   ```
   Ensure that the `.airgap` air gap bundle is present.

1. On the same machine, use a browser to access the Admin Console.

1. From the Admin Console dashboard or **Version history** page, click **Upload new version** and choose the `.airgap` air gap bundle you downloaded.
