* Linux operating system

* x86-64 architecture

* systemd

* At least 2GB of memory and 2 CPU cores

* The filesystem at `/var/lib/embedded-cluster` has 40Gi or more of total space and must be less than 80% full

   :::note
   The directory used for data storage can be changed by passing the `--data-dir` flag with the Embedded Cluster install command. For more information, see [Embedded Cluster Install Command Options](/reference/embedded-cluster-install).

   Note that in addition to the primary `/var/lib/embedded-cluster` directory, Embedded Cluster creates directories and files in the following locations:

      - `/etc/cni`
      - `/etc/k0s`
      - `/opt/cni`
      - `/opt/containerd`
      - `/run/calico`
      - `/run/containerd`
      - `/run/k0s`
      - `/sys/fs/cgroup/kubepods`
      - `/sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/containerd.service`
      - `/sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/k0scontroller.service`
      - `/usr/libexec/k0s`
      - `/var/lib/calico`
      - `/var/lib/cni`
      - `/var/lib/containers`
      - `/var/lib/kubelet`
      - `/var/log/calico`
      - `/var/log/containers`
      - `/var/log/pods`
      - `/usr/local/bin/k0s`

* (Online installations only) Access to replicated.app and proxy.replicated.com or your custom domain for each

* Embedded Cluster is based on k0s, so all k0s system requirements and external runtime dependencies apply. See [System requirements](https://docs.k0sproject.io/stable/system-requirements/) and [External runtime dependencies](https://docs.k0sproject.io/stable/external-runtime-deps/) in the k0s documentation.
