* Linux operating system
* x86-64 architecture
* systemd
* At least 2GB of memory and 2 CPU cores
* Disk space requirements:
  * The filesystem at `/var/lib/embedded-cluster` has 40Gi or more of total space
  * The filesystem at `/var/lib/k0s` has 40Gi or more of total space and must be no more than 80% full
  * The filesystem at `/opt/openebs` has 5Gi or more of total space
  * The filesystem at `/tmp` has 5Gi or more of total space
* Embedded Cluster is based on k0s, so all k0s system requirements apply. See [System requirements](https://docs.k0sproject.io/stable/system-requirements/) in the k0s documentation.
