Embedded Cluster 2.4.0 and later also respects the `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, and `no_proxy` environment variables for installing behind a proxy. When set, the `--http-proxy`, `--https-proxy`, `--no-proxy` flags take precedence over environment variables. Additionally, lowercase environment variables (`http_proxy`) take precedence over uppercase (`HTTP_PROXY`).
