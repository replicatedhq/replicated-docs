This section lists the ports used by Embedded Cluster. These ports must be open and available for both single- and multi-node installations.

#### Ports Used by Local Processes

The following ports must be open and available for use by local processes running on the same node. It is not necessary to create firewall openings for these ports.

* 2379/TCP
* 9099/TCP
* 10248/TCP
* 10257/TCP
* 10259/TCP

#### Ports Required for Bidirectional Communication Between Nodes

The following ports are used for bidirectional communication between nodes.

For multi-node installations, create firewall openings between nodes for these ports.

For single-node installations, ensure that there are no other processes using these ports. Although there is no communication between nodes in single-node installations, these ports are still required.

* 2380/TCP
* 4789/UDP
* 6443/TCP
* 7443/TCP
* 9091/TCP
* 9443/TCP
* 10249/TCP
* 10250/TCP
* 10256/TCP

#### Admin Console Port

The KOTS Admin Console requires that port 30000/TCP is open and available. Create a firewall opening for port 30000/TCP so that the Admin Console can be accessed by the end user.

Additionally, port 30000 must be accessible by nodes joining the cluster.

If port 30000 is occupied, you can select a different port for the Admin Console during installation. For more information, see [Embedded Cluster Install Command Options](/reference/embedded-cluster-install).

#### LAM Port

The Local Artifact Mirror (LAM) requires that port 50000/TCP is open and available.

If port 50000 is occupied, you can select a different port for the LAM during installation. For more information, see [Embedded Cluster Install Command Options](/reference/embedded-cluster-install).
