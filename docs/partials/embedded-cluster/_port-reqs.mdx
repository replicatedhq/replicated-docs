Embedded Cluster requires that the following ports are open and available:

* 2379/TCP &#42;
* 2380/TCP
* 4789/UDP
* 6443/TCP
* 7443/TCP
* 9091/TCP
* 9099/TCP &#42;
* 9443/TCP
* 10248/TCP &#42;
* 10249/TCP
* 10250/TCP
* 10256/TCP
* 10257/TCP &#42;

* 30000/TCP &#42;&#42;&#42;
* 50000/TCP &#42; &#42;&#42; &#42;&#42;&#42;

&#42; These ports are used only by processes running on the same node. Ensure that there are no other processes using them. It is not necessary to create firewall openings for these ports. 

&#42;&#42; Required for air gap installations only.

&#42;&#42;&#42; By default, the Admin Console and Local Artifact Mirror (LAM) run on ports 30000 and 50000, respectively. If these ports are occupied, you can select different ports during installation. For more information, see [Embedded Cluster Install Command Options](/reference/embedded-cluster-install).
