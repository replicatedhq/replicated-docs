The RBAC policy that you specify also determines the level of access that the user has to the Replicated collab repository in GitHub. By default, the Read Only policy grants the user read access to the collab repository.

For more information about managing user access to the collab repository from the Vendor Portal, see [Manage Access to the Collab Repository](team-management-github-username).
