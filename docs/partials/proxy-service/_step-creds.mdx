In the Vendor Portal, go to **Images > Add external registry** and provide read-only credentials for your registry. This allows Replicated to access the images through the proxy registry. See [Add Credentials for an External Registry](packaging-private-images#add-credentials-for-an-external-registry) in _Connecting to an External Registry_.
