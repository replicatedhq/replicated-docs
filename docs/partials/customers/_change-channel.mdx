You can change the channel a customer is assigned at any time. For installations with a Replicated installer (Embedded Cluster, KOTS, kURL), when you change the customer's channel, the customer can sync their license in the Admin Console to fetch the latest release on the new channel and then upgrade. The Admin Console always fetches the latest release on the new channel, regardless of the presence of any releases on the channel that are marked as required.
