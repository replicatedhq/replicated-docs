Preflight checks and support bundles are provided by the Troubleshoot open source project, which is maintained by Replicated. Troubleshoot is a kubectl plugin that provides diagnostic tools for Kubernetes applications. For more information, see the open source [Troubleshoot](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/collect/) documentation.

Preflight checks and support bundles analyze data from customer environments to provide insights that help users to avoid or troubleshoot common issues with an application:
* **Preflight checks** run before an application is installed to check that the customer environment meets the application requirements.
* **Support bundles** collect troubleshooting data from customer environments to help users diagnose problems with application deployments.
