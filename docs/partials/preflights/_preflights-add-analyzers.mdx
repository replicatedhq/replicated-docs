Add analyzers to analyze the data from the collectors that you specified. Define the criteria for the pass, fail, and/or warn outcomes and specify custom messages for each. 

For example, you can set a `fail` outcome if the MySQL version is less than the minimum required. Then, specify a message to display that informs your customer of the reasons for the failure and steps they can take to fix the issue.
