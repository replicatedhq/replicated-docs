1. In your Helm chart `templates` directory, add the following YAML to a Kubernetes Secret to enable the default support bundle spec for your application:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      labels:
        troubleshoot.sh/kind: support-bundle
      name: example
    stringData:
      support-bundle-spec: |
        apiVersion: troubleshoot.sh/v1beta2
        kind: SupportBundle
        metadata:
          name: support-bundle
        spec:
          collectors: []
          analyzers: []
    ```
    :::note
    If your application is installed as multiple Helm charts, you can optionally create separate support bundle specs in each chart. The specs are automatically merged when a support bundle is generated. Alternatively, continue with a single support bundle spec and then optionally revisit how you organize your support bundle specs after you finish onboarding.

1. (Recommended) At a minimum, Replicated recommends that all support bundle specs include the `logs` collector. This collects logs from running Pods in the cluster.

   **Example:**

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   metadata:
     name: example
     labels:
       troubleshoot.sh/kind: support-bundle
   stringData: 
     support-bundle-spec: |-
       apiVersion: troubleshoot.sh/v1beta2
       kind: SupportBundle
       metadata:
         name: example
       spec:
         collectors:
           - logs:
               selector:
                 - app.kubernetes.io/name=myapp
               namespace: {{ .Release.Namespace }}
               limits:
                 maxAge: 720h
                 maxLines: 10000
   ```

1. (Recommended) Ensure that any preflight checks that you added are also included in your support bundle spec. This ensures that support bundles collect at least the same information that is collected when running preflight checks.
