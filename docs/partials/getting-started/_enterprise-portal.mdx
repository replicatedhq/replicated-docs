The Replicated Enterprise Portal is a customizable, web-based portal where your customers can find installation instructions, check for application updates, manage their team members, upload support bundles, and more. For more information, see [About the Enterprise Portal](/vendor/enterprise-portal-about).

To set up the Enterprise Portal:

1. (Recommended) Add a custom domain for the Enterprise Portal. See [Use Custom Domains](/vendor/custom-domains-using).

    :::note
    You can also do this later as part of [Alias Replicated Endpoints With Your Own Domains](#custom-domains).
    :::

1. Customize Enteprise Portal settings and the customer-facing install and upgrade instructions. See [Customize the Enterprise Portal](/vendor/enterprise-portal-configure).

1. Enable the Enterprise Portal for an internal development customer so that you can test your changes. For information about how to enable and then access the Enterprise Portal for a customer, see [Manage Customer Access to the Enterprise Portal](/vendor/enterprise-portal-invite) and [View a Customer's Enterprise Portal](/vendor/enterprise-portal-access). For information about how end customers can log in to and use the Enterprise Portal, see [Log In To and Use the Enterprise Portal](/vendor/enterprise-portal-use).

1. When you are ready, enable the Enterprise Portal so that it is available to one or more of your end customers. You can enable the Enterprise Portal for all customers by default, or manage access on a per-customer basis. For more information, see [Manage Customer Access to the Enterprise Portal](/vendor/enterprise-portal-invite).

1. (Optional) Enable self-service signups so that current and potential customers can access your application by signing up for a trial or community license through the Enterprise Portal. See [Enable Self-Service Sign-Ups](/vendor/enterprise-portal-self-serve-signup).
