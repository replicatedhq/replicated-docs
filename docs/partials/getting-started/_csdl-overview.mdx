Commercial software distribution is the business process that independent software vendors (ISVs) use to enable enterprise customers to self-host a fully private instance of the vendor's application in an environment controlled by the customer.

Replicated has developed the Commercial Software Distribution Lifecycle to represents the stages that are essential for every company that wants to deliver their software securely and reliably to customer controlled environments.

This lifecycle was inspired by the DevOps lifecycle and the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), but it focuses on the unique things that must be done to successfully distribute third party, commercial software to tens, hundreds, or thousands of enterprise customers.
