Your customers are exposed to several Replicated domains by default. Replicated recommends you use custom domains to unify the customer's experience with your brand and simplify security reviews.

After adding a custom domain for the Replicated proxy registry, be sure to update any image references in your Helm chart values to point to your custom domain rather than the proxy registry at `proxy.replicated.com`. For more information, see [Task 2: Modify Image References in Helm Values to Point to the Proxy Registry](#task-2).
