Your customers are exposed to several Replicated domains by default. Replicated recommends you use custom domains to unify the customer's experience with your brand and simplify security reviews. For more information, see [About Custom Domains](/vendor/custom-domains).

To add and use custom domains for Replicated endpoints:

1. Add and verify your custom domain(s) in the Vendor Portal. See [Add a Custom Domain in the Vendor Portal](/vendor/custom-domains-using#add-domain).

1. If you add a custom domain for the Replicated proxy registry, update any image references in your Helm chart values to point to your custom domain rather than the proxy registry at `proxy.replicated.com`.
