Required releases have the following limitations:

  * Required releases are supported in KOTS v1.68.0 and later.
  * After users deploy a required version, they can no longer redeploy (roll back to) versions earlier than the required version, even if `allowRollback` is true in the Application custom resource manifest. For more information, see [`allowRollback`](/reference/custom-resource-application#allowrollback) in the Application custom resource topic.
  * If you change the channel an existing customer is assigned to, the admin console always fetches the latest release on the new channel, regardless of any required releases on the channel. For more information, see [Channel Assignment](licenses-about#channel-assignment) in _About Customers_.
