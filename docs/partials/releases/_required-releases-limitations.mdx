Required releases have the following limitations:

  * Required releases are supported in KOTS v1.68.0 and later.
  * After users deploy a required version, they can no longer redeploy (roll back to) versions earlier than the required version, even if `allowRollback` is true in the Application custom resource manifest. For more information, see [`allowRollback`](/reference/custom-resource-application#allowrollback) in the Application custom resource topic.
  * If you change the channel an existing customer is assigned to, the Admin Console always fetches the latest release on the new channel, regardless of any required releases on the channel. For more information, see [Channel Assignment](licenses-about#channel-assignment) in _About Customers_.
  * Required releases are not supported for Helm CLI installations. The **Prevent this release from being skipped during upgrades** option has no affect when the user installs with Helm.  
  * For installations using KOTS 1.125.2 or earlier, if you disable the **Prevent this release from being skipped during upgrades** option for a promoted release, the release will still be marked as required in the Admin Console and users must still upgrade to the given version before they can upgrade to later versions.
  
     To skip a previously required release during upgrades, users must first update their installation to KOTS 1.126.0 or later. In KOTS 1.126.0 and later, release metadata in the Admin Console (including the release's requirement status) is updated during upstream update checks.
