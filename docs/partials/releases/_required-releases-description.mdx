When a release is required, KOTS requires users to upgrade to that version before they can upgrade to a later version. For example, if you select **Prevent this release from being skipped during upgrades** for release 2.0.0, users with 1.5.0 deployed must upgrade to 2.0.0 before they can upgrade to 2.1.0.

You can disable the **Prevent this release from being skipped during upgrades** option after promoting a release if needed to allow users to skip the release during upgrades. After a release's properties are changed in the Vendor Portal, its metadata is updated in the Admin Console the next time that an upstream update occurs.
