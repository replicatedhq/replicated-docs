When a release is marked as required, users must upgrade to the required release version before they can upgrade to a later version. For example, if 2.0.0 is a required release, users with 1.5.0 deployed must upgrade to 2.0.0 before they can upgrade to 2.1.0.

For online (internet-connected) installations using KOTS 1.126.0 or later, you can disable the **Prevent this release from being skipped during upgrades** option for a release to mark the release as no longer required. The requirement will be removed from the given release in the Admin Console the next time that an upstream update check occurs.
