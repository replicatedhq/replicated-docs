The ConfigValues resource passed to the install command must meet the following requirements:
* Must be valid YAML
* Must list all configuration items that are defined in the corresponding Config resource in the release
* For each item in the Config resource that has a default, the ConfigValues must also list the item's default. Default values are not automatically merged from the Config resource during installation.
* For any configuration items of type `password`, provide the password in plain text in a `valuePlainText` property rather than in the `value` property. For example, `valuePlainText: somesecretvalue`.
