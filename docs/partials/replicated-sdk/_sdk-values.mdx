When a user installs a Helm chart that includes the Replicated SDK as a dependency, the SDK injects a set of `replicated` values in the parent chart's values file. These values include:
* Details about the given application release from the Vendor Portal, such as the version label, channel release sequence, and the release images.
* Details about the customer license, including the complete YAML representation of the customer license. For more information, see [Replicated SDK `replicated.license` Value](#replicated-sdk-replicatedlicense-value) on this page.
* Details about the SDK deployment, such as the Replicated SDK image location and properties, container resource requirements that control CPU and memory allocation, and the pod and container security context.
* Customizable settings for the SDK, such as RBAC settings, custom labels and annotations applied to the SDK Helm chart, and high availability (HA) deployment settings. For more information about how to customize the Replicated SDK, see [Customize the Replicated SDK](/vendor/replicated-sdk-customizing).

For the complete list of Replicated SDK Helm values, see the [`values.yaml`](https://github.com/replicatedhq/replicated-sdk/blob/main/chart/values.yaml) file for the SDK Helm chart in GitHub.

### Example

The following is an example of Replicated SDK `replicated` values for an application named NGINX that was installed in a cluster with Helm. These values are injected in the `values.yaml` file for the parent Helm chart of the NGINX application.

```yaml
# NGINX parent Helm chart values.yaml file

replicated:
  affinity: null
  appID: ""
  appName: NGINX
  automountServiceAccountToken: false
  channelID: 38FsA8b1C8LP6Ifzql89MGXYGwx
  channelName: Unstable
  channelSequence: 5
  clusterRole: ""
  commonAnnotations: {}
  commonLabels: {}
  isAirgap: false
  # ... several additional values ommitted for brevity
  reportAllImages: false
  resources:
    limits:
      cpu: 500m
      memory: 500Mi
    requests:
      cpu: 100m
      memory: 100Mi
  restartPolicy: Always
  schedulerName: ""
  service:
    port: 3000
    type: ClusterIP
  serviceAccountName: ""
  statusInformers: null
  terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30
  tlsCertSecretName: ""
  tolerations: []
  topologySpreadConstraints: []
  versionLabel: 0.0.2
```

### Replicated SDK `replicated.license` Value

The Replicated SDK includes a `replicated.license` value that contains a YAML representation of the customer license. For more information about the built-in fields included in all Replicated licenses, see [Built-In License Fields](/vendor/licenses-using-builtin-fields).

The following shows an example of the `replicated.license` value for a customer named Nitflex:

```yaml
# NGINX parent Helm chart values.yaml file 

replicated:
  # YAML representation of the customer's license
  license: |
    apiVersion: kots.io/v1beta1
    kind: License

        - channelID: 38FsA8b1C8LP6Ifzql89MGXYGwx
          channelName: Unstable
