When a user installs a Helm chart that includes the Replicated SDK as a dependency, a set of default SDK values are included in the `replicated` key of the parent chart's values file.

For example:

```yaml
# values.yaml 

replicated:
  enabled: true
  appName: gitea
  channelID: 2jKkegBMseH5w...
  channelName: Beta
  channelSequence: 33
  integration:
    enabled: true
  license: {}
  parentChartURL: oci://registry.replicated.com/gitea/beta/gitea
  releaseCreatedAt: "2024-11-25T20:38:22Z"
  releaseNotes: 'CLI release'
  releaseSequence: 88
  replicatedAppEndpoint: https://replicated.app
  versionLabel: Beta-1234
```

These `replicated` values can be referenced by the application or set during installation as needed. For example, if users need to add labels or annotations to everything that runs in their cluster, then they can pass the labels or annotations to the relevant value in the SDK subchart.

For the default Replicated SDK Helm chart values file, see [values.yaml.tmpl](https://github.com/replicatedhq/replicated-sdk/blob/main/chart/values.yaml.tmpl) in the [replicated-sdk](https://github.com/replicatedhq/replicated-sdk) repository in GitHub.

The SDK Helm values also include a `replicated.license` field, which is a string that contains the YAML representation of the customer license. For more information about the built-in fields in customer licenses, see [Built-In License Fields](licenses-using-builtin-fields).
