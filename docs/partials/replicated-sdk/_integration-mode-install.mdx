You can install the Replicated SDK in integration mode to develop locally against the SDK API without needing to add the SDK to your application, create a release in the Replicated Vendor Portal, or make changes in your environment. You can also use integration mode to test sending instance data to the Vendor Portal, including any custom metrics that you configure.

To use integration mode, install the Replicated SDK as a standalone component using a valid Development license created in the Vendor Portal. After you install in integration mode, the SDK provides default mock data for requests to the SDK API `app` endpoints. Requests to the `license` endpoints use the real data from your Development license.

To install the SDK in integration mode:

1. Create a Development license that you can use to install the SDK in integration mode:

   1. In the Vendor Portal, go to **Customers** and click **Create customer**.

   1. Complete the following fields:
      
      1. For **Customer name**, add a name for the customer.
      
      1. For **Assigned channel**, assign the customer to the channel that you use for testing. For example, Unstable.
      
      1. For **Customer type**, select **Development**.
      
      1. For **Customer email**, add the email address that you want to use for the license.

      1. For **Install types**, ensure that the **Existing Cluster (Helm CLI)** option is enabled.

      1. (Optional) Add any license field values that you want to use for testing:

         1. For **Expiration policy**, you can add an expiration date for the license. 

         1. For **Custom fields**, you can add values for any custom license fields in your application. For information about how to create custom license fields, see [Managing Customer License Fields](/vendor/licenses-adding-custom-fields).

   1. Click **Save Changes**.

1. On the **Manage customer** page for the customer you created, click **Helm install instructions**.

1. Make requests to the SDK API from your application. You can access the SDK API for testing by forwarding the API service to your local machine. For more information, see [Port Forwarding the SDK API Service](/vendor/replicated-sdk-development#port-forward).
