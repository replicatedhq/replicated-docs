Specifies the order in which Helm charts should be installed within the application. Charts should be installed by weight in ascending order, with lower weights applied first. **Supported values:** Positive or negative integers. **Default:** `0`

The Replicated Enterprise Portal uses these weights to order the list of charts in the install and update instuctions they provide. See [View Install and Update Instructions](https://docs.replicated.com/vendor/enterprise-portal-use#view-install-and-update-instructions). When installing with KOTS or the Embedded Cluster, `weight` determines the order in which KOTS applies the Helm chart. 

In KOTS v1.99.0 and later, `weight` also determines the order in which charts are uninstalled. Charts are uninstalled by weight in descending order, with higher weights uninstalled first. For more information about uninstalling applications, see [remove](kots-cli-remove) in _KOTS CLI_.
