Determines the order in which KOTS applies the Helm chart. Charts are applied by weight in ascending order, with lower weights applied first. **Supported values:** Positive or negative integers. **Default:** `0`

In KOTS v1.99.0 and later, `weight` also determines the order in which charts are uninstalled. Charts are uninstalled by weight in descending order, with higher weights uninstalled first. For more information about uninstalling applications, see [remove](kots-cli-remove) in _KOTS CLI_.
