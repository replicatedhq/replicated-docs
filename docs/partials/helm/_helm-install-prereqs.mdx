* You must have a customer in the Replicated Vendor Portal with a valid email address. This email address is only used as a username for the Replicated registry and is never contacted. For more information about creating and editing customers in the Vendor Portal, see [Creating a Customer](/vendor/releases-creating-customer).

* To ensure that the Replicated proxy registry can be used to grant proxy access to your application images during Helm installations, you must create an image pull secret for the proxy registry and add it to your Helm chart. To do so, follow the steps in [Using the Proxy Registry with Helm Installations](/vendor/helm-image-registry).

* (Recommended) To install the Replicated SDK alongside the application, declare the SDK as a dependency. For more information, see [Install the SDK as a Subchart](replicated-sdk-installing#install-the-sdk-as-a-subchart) in _Installing the Replicated SDK_.
