Any other Kubernetes resources in the release (such as Kubernetes Deployments or Services) must include the `kots.io/installer-only` annotation.

The `kots.io/installer-only` annotation indicates that the Kubernetes resource is used only by the Replicated installers (Embedded Cluster, KOTS, and kURL).

Example:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
  annotations:
    kots.io/installer-only: "true"
```
