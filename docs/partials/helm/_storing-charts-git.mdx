Because the Helm chart tarball that is pulled from the Replicated registry in Helm CLI installations contains secrets and customer-specific values (including the `global.replicated.dockerconfigjson` registry authentication credentials and customer license data), teams should take caution when storing the chart's `values.yaml` file in Git.

For teams that use GitOps or other CI/CD workflows, Replicated recommends that you do one of the following to avoid accidentally exposing customer-specific secrets in Git:

* Pull the Helm chart at deploy time only, rather than committing the chart in Git

* Alternatively, remove the `global.replicated` values from the chart's `values.yaml` file before committing the chart. Then re-inject the `global.replicated` values at deploy time using a secret manager.
