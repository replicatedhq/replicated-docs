Using KOTS template functions in the [License](/reference/template-functions-license-context) context allows you to set Helm values based on the unique license file used for installation or upgrade.

For example, the following HelmChart custom resource uses the Replicated [LiencseFieldValue](/reference/template-functions-license-context#licensefieldvalue) template function to evaluate if the license has the `newFeatureEntitlement` field set to `true`:

```yaml
# KOTS HelmChart custom resource

apiVersion: kots.io/v1beta2
kind: HelmChart
metadata:
  name: samplechart
spec:
  chart:
    name: samplechart
    chartVersion: 3.1.7
  
  releaseName: samplechart-release-1

  values:
    newFeature:
      enabled: '{{repl (LicenseFieldValue "newFeatureEntitlement") }}'
```

During installation or upgrade, the LicenseFieldValue template function is rendered based on the user's license. Then, KOTS sets the matching `newFeature.enabled` value in the Helm chart `values.yaml` file accordingly.
