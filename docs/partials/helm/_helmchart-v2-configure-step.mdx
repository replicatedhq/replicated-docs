For each Helm chart in the release, find the corresponding HelmChart custom resource and update `apiVersion` to `kots.io/v1beta2`. Then, do the following to configure the HelmChart v2 custom resource:
   1. Rewrite image names to use the Replicated proxy registry and inject the image pull secret for the proxy registry. See [HelmChart v2](/vendor/private-images-kots#helmchart-v2) in _Use the Proxy Registry with Replicated Installers_.
   1. Configure the `builder` key to allow your users to push images to their own local registries. See [builder](/reference/custom-resource-helmchart-v2#builder) in _HelmChart v2_.
   1. Rewrite image names to the user's local image registry, if a local registry was configured. See [Rewrite Application Image Names with HelmChart v2 for Local Registries](/vendor/helmchart-local-registries).
   1. Add a pull secret for any Docker Hub images that could be rate limited. See [Configure Local Image Registries in the Admin Console](/enterprise/image-registry-settings).
   1. (KOTS Existing Cluster and kURL Installations Only) Add the `kots.io/backup: velero` and `kots.io/app-slug: APP_SLUG` backup labels to your resources to support backup and restore with the KOTS snapshots feature. See [Configure Snapshots](/vendor/snapshots-configuring-backups).
