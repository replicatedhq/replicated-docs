## kots.io/installer-only Annotation

When added to a HelmChart custom resource or other Kubernetes resource and set to true, the `kots.io/installer-only` annotation does the following:
- Excludes the chart from the Helm CLI install and upgrade instructions displayed in the Vendor Portal and Enterprise Portal
- Excludes the chart from Security Center reports for Helm CLI installations

Charts with `kots.io/installer-only: "true"` are still deployed when using Replicated installers (Embedded Cluster, KOTS, and kURL) and are still included in Security Center reports for Replicated installer deployments.

This annotation is useful for charts that are required for Replicated installer-based deployments but should not be visible or installed when customers use the Helm CLI.

### When to Use This Annotation

The `kots.io/installer-only` annotation is needed in these scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Resources Inside Helm Chart Templates**

If you have Kubernetes resources (Deployments, Jobs, Services, etc.) **inside a Helm chart's templates** that should only deploy with Replicated installers:

- Without annotation: Resource deploys with BOTH Helm CLI and Replicated installers
- With annotation: Resource only deploys with Replicated installers

**Scenario 2: Entire Helm Charts**

If you have a HelmChart custom resource that references a chart needed only for Replicated installers:

- The annotation on the HelmChart CR excludes the entire chart from Helm CLI installations

**Scenario 3: Standalone Manifests**

Standard Kubernetes resources that are NOT part of any Helm chart are **automatically excluded** from Helm CLI installations. You do not need to add this annotation to standalone manifests.

:::note
HelmChart custom resources are Replicated-specific and never deployed by Helm CLI. The annotation controls whether the chart they reference is included in Helm installation instructions.

### Example: HelmChart Custom Resource

```yaml
apiVersion: kots.io/v1beta2
kind: HelmChart
metadata:
  name: installers-only-chart
  annotations:
    kots.io/installer-only: "true"
spec:
  chart:
    name: installers-only-chart
    chartVersion: 1.0.0
```

### Example: Resource Inside a Helm Chart

This example shows a Kubernetes Job inside a Helm chart's templates that should only run during Replicated installer deployments:

**File:** `your-chart/templates/preflight-job.yaml`

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: {{ .Release.Name }}-preflight
  annotations:
    kots.io/installer-only: "true"
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: preflight-checks
        image: replicated/preflight:latest
        command: ["/bin/sh"]
        args: ["-c", "echo Running installer-specific preflight checks"]
      restartPolicy: Never
```

**Why the annotation is needed:** Without it, this Job would run during both Helm CLI and Replicated installer deployments. The annotation ensures it only runs with Replicated installers where the preflight tooling is available.

**Standalone manifests:** If this Job were a standalone manifest in your release (not inside a Helm chart), it would automatically be excluded from Helm CLI installations without needing the annotation.
