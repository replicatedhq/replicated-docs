## kots.io/installer-only Annotation

When added to a HelmChart custom resource and set to true, the `kots.io/installer-only` annotation does the following:
- Excludes the chart from the Helm CLI install and upgrade instructions displayed in the Vendor Portal and Enterprise Portal
- Excludes the chart from Security Center reports for Helm CLI installations

Charts with `kots.io/installer-only: "true"` are still deployed when using Replicated installers (Embedded Cluster, KOTS, and kURL) and are still included in Security Center reports for Replicated installer deployments.

This annotation is useful for charts that are required for Replicated installer-based deployments but should not be visible or installed when customers use the Helm CLI.

### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: kots.io/v1beta2
kind: HelmChart
metadata:
  name: kots-only-chart
  annotations:
    kots.io/installer-only: "true"
spec:
  chart:
    name: kots-only-chart
    chartVersion: 1.0.0
```
