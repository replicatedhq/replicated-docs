## kots.io/installer-only Annotation

The `kots.io/installer-only` annotation can be added to a HelmChart custom resource to exclude the chart from Helm CLI installations and Helm-specific Security Center reports.

When set to `"true"`, charts with this annotation:
- Will not appear in Helm install instructions displayed in the Vendor Portal or Enterprise Portal
- Will not be included in Security Center reports for Helm CLI installations
- Will still be deployed when using Replicated installers (Embedded Cluster, KOTS, and kURL)
- Will still be included in Security Center reports for Replicated installer deployments

This annotation is useful for charts that are required only for Replicated installer-based deployments but should not be visible or installed when customers use the Helm CLI.

### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: kots.io/v1beta2
kind: HelmChart
metadata:
  name: kots-only-chart
  annotations:
    kots.io/installer-only: "true"
spec:
  chart:
    name: kots-only-chart
    chartVersion: 1.0.0
```

In this example, the `kots-only-chart` will be deployed when using Replicated installers but will be excluded from Helm CLI install instructions and Security Center reports.
