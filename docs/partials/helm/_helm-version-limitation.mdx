Support for Helm v2, including security patches, ended on November 13, 2020. If you specified `helmVersion: v2` in any HelmChart custom resources, update your references to v3. By default, KOTS uses Helm v3 to process all Helm charts to create deployable YAML, and only v3 is supported for native Helm.
