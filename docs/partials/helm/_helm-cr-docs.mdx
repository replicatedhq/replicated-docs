The `docs` key is an optional attribute for displaying documentation about the chart to users via the the Replicated Vendor Portal.

The format is a YAML map: keys represent docs section names, and their value is expected to be a YAML multiline markdown block. Section names can be any string, such as `install`, `prerequisites`, and `troubleshooting` in the example below:

```yaml
apiVersion: kots.io/v1beta2
kind: HelmChart
