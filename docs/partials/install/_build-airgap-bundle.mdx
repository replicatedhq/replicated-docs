Go the channel where the target release was promoted to build and download the air gap bundle for the release:
   * If the **Automatically create airgap builds for newly promoted releases in this channel** setting is enabled on the channel, watch for the build status to complete.
   * If automatic air gap builds are not enabled, go to the **Release history** page for the channel and build the air gap bundle manually.
