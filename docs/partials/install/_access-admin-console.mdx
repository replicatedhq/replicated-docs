By default, during installation, KOTS automatically opens localhost port 8800 to provide access to the Admin Console. Using the `--no-port-forward` flag with the `kots install` command prevents KOTS from creating a port forward to the Admin Console.

After you install with the `--no-port-forward` flag, you can optionally create a port forward so that you can log in to the Admin Console in a browser window.

To access the Admin Console:

1. If you installed in a VM where you cannot open a browser window, forward a port on your local machine to `localhost:8800` on the remote VM using the SSH client:

   ```bash
   ssh -L LOCAL_PORT:localhost:8800 USERNAME@IP_ADDRESS
   ```
   Replace:
    * `LOCAL_PORT` with the port on your local machine to forward. For example, `9900` or `8800`.
    * `USERNAME` with your username for the VM.
    * `IP_ADDRESS` with the IP address for the VM.

   **Example**:

   The following example shows using the SSH client to forward port 8800 on your local machine to `localhost:8800` on the remote VM.
  
   ```bash
   ssh -L 8800:localhost:8800 user@ip-addr
   ```

1. Run the following KOTS CLI command to open localhost port 8800, which forwards to the Admin Console service:

   ```bash
   kubectl kots admin-console --namespace NAMESPACE
   ```
   Replace `NAMESPACE` with the namespace where the Admin Console was installed.

   For more information about the `kots admin-console` command, see [admin-console](/reference/kots-cli-admin-console-index) in the _KOTS CLI_ documentation.

1. Open a browser window and go to `https://localhost:8800`.

1. Log in to the Admin Console using the password that you created as part of the `kots install` command.
