When prompted by the `kots install` command:
  1. Provide the namespace where you want to install both KOTS and the application.
  1. Create a new password for logging in to the admin console.

    **Example**:

    ```shell
    $ kubectl kots install application-name
    Enter the namespace to deploy to: application-name
      • Deploying Admin Console
        • Creating namespace ✓
        • Waiting for datastore to be ready ✓
    Enter a new password to be used for the Admin Console: ••••••••
      • Waiting for Admin Console to be ready ✓

      • Press Ctrl+C to exit
      • Go to http://localhost:8800 to access the Admin Console

    ```   

  After the `kots install` command completes, it creates a port forward to the admin console. The admin console is exposed internally in the cluster and can only be accessed using a port forward.
