The domains for the services listed in the table below need to be accessible from servers performing online installations. No outbound internet access is required for air gap installations.

For services hosted at domains owned by Replicated, the table below includes a link to the list of IP addresses for the domain at [replicatedhq/ips](https://github.com/replicatedhq/ips/blob/main/ip_addresses.json) in GitHub. Note that the IP addresses listed in the `replicatedhq/ips` repository also include IP addresses for some domains that are _not_ required for installation.

For third-party services hosted at domains not owned by Replicated, the table below lists the required domains. Consult the third-party's documentation for the IP address range for each domain, as needed.
