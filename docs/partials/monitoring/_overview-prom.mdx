The KOTS Admin Console can use the open source systems monitoring tool Prometheus to collect metrics on an application and the cluster where the application is installed. Prometheus components include the main Prometheus server, which scrapes and stores time series data, an Alertmanager for alerting on metrics, and Grafana for visualizing metrics. For more information about Prometheus, see [What is Prometheus?](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/) in the Prometheus documentation.

The Admin Console exposes graphs with key metrics collected by Prometheus in the **Monitoring** section of the dashboard. By default, the Admin Console displays the following graphs:

* Cluster disk usage
* Pod CPU usage
* Pod memory usage

In addition to these default graphs, application developers can also expose business and application level metrics and alerts on the dashboard.

The following screenshot shows an example of the **Monitoring** section on the Admin Console dashboard with the Disk Usage, CPU Usage, and Memory Usage default graphs:
