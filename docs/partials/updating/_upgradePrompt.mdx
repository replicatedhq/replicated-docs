(Kubernetes Upgrades Only) If a Kubernetes upgrade is required, the script automatically prints a `Drain local node and apply upgrade?` prompt. Confirm the prompt to drain the local primary node and apply the Kubernetes upgrade to the control plane.

   The script continues to drain and upgrade nodes sequentially. For each node, the script prints a command that you must run on the node to upgrade Kubernetes. For more information, see [About Updating Kubernetes Installer Clusters](#overview) above.
