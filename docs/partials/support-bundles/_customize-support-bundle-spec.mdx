When customizing your support bundle specifications, consider the following guidelines:

- The `clusterInfo` and `clusterResources` collectors are useful because they collect a large amount of data to help with installation and debugging.

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: troubleshoot.sh/v1beta2
  kind: SupportBundle
  metadata:
    name: collectors
  spec:
    collectors:
      - clusterInfo:
        exclude: false
      - clusterResources:
        exclude: false
  ```
- You can edit the default collector properties. If  `clusterResources` is defined in your specification, the default namespace cannot be removed, but you can add a namespace to the `namespaces` field.

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: troubleshoot.sh/v1beta2
  kind: SupportBundle
  metadata:
    name: collectors
  spec:
    collectors:
      - clusterInfo:
        exclude: false
      - clusterResources:
        namespaces:
        - default
        - APP_NAMESPACE
  ```
  Replace `APP_NAMESPACE` with the application namespace.

- Add application Pod logs and set the collection limits for the number of lines logged. Typically the selector attribute is matched to the labels.

    1. To get the labels for an application, inspect the Pods YAML.

    1. Create collectors to include logs from these pods in a bundle. Depending on the complexity of an application's labeling schema, you might need a few different declarations of the logs collector. You can include the `logs` collector specification multiple times.

      The limits field can support `maxAge` or `maxLines`. This limits the output to the constraints provided. **Default:** `maxLines: 10000`

      **Example:**

      ```yaml
      apiVersion: troubleshoot.sh/v1beta2
      kind: SupportBundle
      metadata:
        name: collectors
      spec:
        collectors:
          - logs:
            selector:
              - app=api
            namespace: default
            limits:
              maxLines: 10000
      ```            

- Add any custom collectors to the file. Collectors that Replicated recommends considering are:

    - **Kubernetes resources:** Use for custom resource definitions (CRDs), secrets, and ConfigMaps, if they are required for your application to work.
    - **Databases:** Return a selection of rows or entire tables.
    - **Volumes:** Ensure that an application's persistent state files exist, are readable/writeable, and have the right permissions.
    - **Pods:** Run a pod from a custom image.
    - **Files:** Copy files from pods and hosts.
    - **HTTP:** Consume your own application APIs with HTTP requests. If your application has its own API that serves status, metrics, performance data, and so on, this information can be collected and analyzed.

- Add analyzers based on conditions that you expect for your application. For example, you might require that a cluster have at least 2 CPUs and 4GB memory available.

  Good analyzers clearly identify failure modes. For example, if you can identify a log message from your database component that indicates a problem, you should write an analyzer that checks for that log.

  At a minimum, include application log analyzers. A simple text analyzer can detect specific log lines and inform an end user of remediation steps.

  Analyzers that Replicated recommends considering are:

    - **Resource statuses:** Check the status of various resources, such as Deployments, StatefulSets, Jobs, and so on.
    - **Regular expressions:** Analyze arbitrary data.
    - **Databases:** Check the version and connection status.

- If needed, you can add custom the redactors to the default redactors. Disabling the redactors is not recommended.
