The support-bundle plugin (a kubectl plugin) is required to generate support bundles from the command line.

:::note
For Replicated Embedded Cluster and Replicated kURL installations, the support-bundle plugin is automatically installed on all of the control plane nodes. You can skip this prerequisite.
:::

#### Mac

For Mac users, Replicated recommends using Homebrew to install the support-bundle plugin:

```bash
brew install support-bundle
```

#### Windows / Linux

For Windows and Linux users, use Krew to install the support-bundle plugin:

* If krew is _not_ installed already, run the following command to install krew and the support-bundle plugin at the same time:

    ```bash
    curl https://krew.sh/support-bundle | bash
    ```

* If krew is installed already, run the following command to install the plug-in:

    ```bash
    kubectl krew install support-bundle
    ```

* To upgrade your existing support-bundle plugin using krew:

    ```bash
    kubectl krew upgrade support-bundle
    ```

#### Install Manually

If you do not want to install the plugin using krew or want an easier way to install the plugin in an air gap environment, you can install the plugin manually from the release archives.

To install the support-bundle plugin manually:

1. Run the following command to download and unarchive the latest release, and move the plugin to your $PATH:

   ```
   curl -L https://github.com/replicatedhq/troubleshoot/releases/latest/download/support-bundle_linux_amd64.tar.gz | tar xzvf -
   sudo mv ./support-bundle /usr/local/bin/kubectl-support_bundle
   ```
   :::note
   If you do not have root access, or choose not to add the support-bundle plugin to your path, you can run the binary directly from where you unzipped it by executing `./support-bundle`.  If you choose not to put the plugin into your $PATH, then replace all instances of `kubectl support-bundle` in these instructions with `./support-bundle` or with the absolute path to the binary.

1. (Optional) Run the following command to test that the installation is working:

   ```
   kubectl support-bundle --help
   ```
