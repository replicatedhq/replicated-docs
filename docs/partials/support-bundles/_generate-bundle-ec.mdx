There are different steps to generate a support bundle depending on the version of Embedded Cluster installed.

### For Versions 1.17.0 and Later

For Embedded Cluster 1.17.0 and later, you can run the Embedded Cluster `support-bundle` command to generate a support bundle.

The `support-bundle` command uses the default Embedded Cluster support bundle spec to collect both cluster- and host-level information. It also automatically includes any application-specific support bundle specs in the generated bundle. 

To generate a support bundle:

1. SSH onto a controller node.

   :::note
   You can SSH onto a worker node to generate a support bundle that contains information specific to that node. However, when run on a worker node, the `support-bundle` command does not capture cluster-wide information.
   :::

1. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo ./APP_SLUG support-bundle
   ```

   Where `APP_SLUG` is the unique slug for the application. 

### For Versions Earlier Than 1.17.0

For Embedded Cluster versions earlier than 1.17.0, you can generate a support bundle from the shell using the kubectl support-bundle plugin.

To generate a bundle with the support-bundle plugin, you pass the default Embedded Cluster spec to collect both cluster- and host-level information. You also pass the `--load-cluster-specs` flag, which discovers all support bundle specs that are defined in Secrets or ConfigMaps in the cluster. This ensures that any application-specific specs are also included in the bundle. For more information, see [Discover Cluster Specs](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/support-bundle/discover-cluster-specs/) in the Troubleshoot documentation.

To generate a bundle:

1. SSH onto a controller node.

1. Use the Embedded Cluster shell command to start a shell with access to the cluster:

     ```bash
     sudo ./APP_SLUG shell
     ```
     Where `APP_SLUG` is the unique slug for the application.

     The output looks similar to the following:

    ```bash
        __4___
    _  \ \ \ \   Welcome to APP_SLUG debug shell.
    <'\ /_/_/_/   This terminal is now configured to access your cluster.
    ((____!___/) Type 'exit' (or CTRL+d) to exit.

    root@alex-ec-2:/home/alex# export PATH="$PATH:/var/lib/embedded-cluster/bin"
    root@alex-ec-2:/home/alex# source <(kubectl completion bash)
    root@alex-ec-2:/home/alex# source /etc/bash_completion
    ```

     The appropriate kubeconfig is exported, and the location of useful binaries like kubectl and the preflight and support-bundle plugins is added to PATH.

     :::note
     The shell command cannot be run on non-controller nodes.

2. Generate the support bundle using the default Embedded Cluster spec and the `--load-cluster-specs` flag:

   ```bash
   kubectl support-bundle  --load-cluster-specs /var/lib/embedded-cluster/support/host-support-bundle.yaml
   ```
