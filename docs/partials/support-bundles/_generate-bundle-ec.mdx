Depending on the version of Embedded Cluster the procedure to generate a support bundle is different, please follow the instructions below.

#### For versions XXX and above

1. SSH onto a controller node.

1. Use the Embedded Cluster `support-bundle` command to generate the support bundle:

   ```bash
   sudo ./APP_SLUG support-bundle
   ```

   Where `APP_SLUG` is the unique slug for the application.

#### For versions prior to XXX

From the shell, you can generate a support bundle for Replicated Embedded Cluster installations to help with troubleshooting.

1. SSH onto a controller node.

1. Use the Embedded Cluster shell command to start a shell with access to the cluster:

     ```bash
     sudo ./APP_SLUG shell
     ```
     Where `APP_SLUG` is the unique slug for the application.

     The output looks similar to the following:

    ```bash
        __4___
    _  \ \ \ \   Welcome to APP_SLUG debug shell.
    <'\ /_/_/_/   This terminal is now configured to access your cluster.
    ((____!___/) Type 'exit' (or CTRL+d) to exit.
    \0\0\0\0\/  Happy hacking.

    root@alex-ec-2:/home/alex# export PATH="$PATH:/var/lib/embedded-cluster/bin"
    root@alex-ec-2:/home/alex# source <(kubectl completion bash)
    root@alex-ec-2:/home/alex# source /etc/bash_completion
    ```

     The appropriate kubeconfig is exported, and the location of useful binaries like kubectl and the preflight and support-bundle plugins is added to PATH.

     :::note
     The shell command cannot be run on non-controller nodes.

2. Generate the support bundle using the default Embedded Cluster spec and the `--load-cluster-specs` flag:

   ```bash
   kubectl support-bundle  --load-cluster-specs /var/lib/embedded-cluster/support/host-support-bundle.yaml
   ```
