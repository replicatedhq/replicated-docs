From the shell, you can generate a support bundle for the Embedded Cluster to help with troubleshooting.

The support bundle collects host-level information to troubleshoot failures related to host configuration like DNS, networking, or storage problems. It also collects cluster-level information about the components provided by Replicated, such as the Admin Console and Embedded Cluster operator that manage install and upgrade operations.

If the cluster hasn't installed successfully and cluster-level information is not available, it will be excluded from the bundle.

To generate a support bundle:

1. SSH onto a controller node.

1. Use the Embedded Cluster shell command to start a shell with access to the cluster:

     ```bash
     sudo ./APP_SLUG shell
     ```
     Where `APP_SLUG` is the unique slug for the application.

     The output looks similar to the following:

     ```bash
            __4___
        _  \ \ \ \   Welcome to APP_SLUG debug shell.
        <'\ /_/_/_/   This terminal is now configured to access your cluster.
        ((____!___/) Type 'exit' (or CTRL+d) to exit.
        \0\0\0\0\/  Happy hacking.

        root@alex-ec-2:/home/alex# source <(kubectl completion bash)
        root@alex-ec-2:/home/alex# source /etc/bash_completion
    ```

    The appropriate kubeconfig is exported, and the location of useful binaries like kubectl and Replicated’s preflight and support-bundle plugins is added to PATH.

    :::note
    The shell command cannot be run on non-controller nodes.

2. Generate the support bundle:

   ```bash
   kubectl support-bundle /var/lib/embedded-cluster/support/host-support-bundle.yaml --load-cluster-specs
   ```
