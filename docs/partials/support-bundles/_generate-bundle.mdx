Run the following command to generate a bundle:

```bash
kubectl support-bundle --load-cluster-specs
```

The `--load-cluster-specs` flag automatically discovers all support bundle specs that are defined in Secrets or ConfigMaps in the cluster. For more information, see [Discover Cluster Specs](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/support-bundle/discover-cluster-specs/) in the Troubleshoot documentation.

For a complete list of options with the `kubectl support-bundle` command, run `kubectl support-bundle --help`. For more information, see [Collecting a Support Bundle](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/support-bundle/collecting/) in the Troubleshoot documentation.
