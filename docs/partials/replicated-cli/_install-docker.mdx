:::note
For Windows users, Replicated recommends using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2) and installing the Replicated using the Linux installations above. See [Linux / Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2)](#linux-wsl2).
:::

To install and run the latest Replicated CLI in Docker environments:

1. Generate a service account or user API token in the vendor portal. To create new releases, the token must have `Read/Write` access. See [Generating API Tokens](/vendor/replicated-api-tokens).

1. Get the latest Replicated CLI installation files from the [replicatedhq/replicated repository](https://github.com/replicatedhq/replicated/releases) on GitHub.

    Download and install the files. For simplicity, the usage in the next step is represented assuming that the CLI is downloaded and installed to the desktop.

1. To begin using the Replicated CLI to manage your applications, authenticate with your Replicated credentials. See [Authenticate](#auth).

   :::note
   Installing in Docker environments requires that you set the `REPLICATED_API_TOKEN` environment variable to authorize the Replicated CLI with an API token. For more information, see [Set Environment Variables](/reference/replicated-cli-installing#env-var).
