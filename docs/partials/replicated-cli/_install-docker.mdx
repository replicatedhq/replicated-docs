:::note
For Windows users, Replicated recommends using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2) and installing the Replicated using the Linux installations above. See [Linux / Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2)](#linux-wsl2).

Installing in Docker environments requires that you set the `REPLICATED_API_TOKEN` environment variable to authorize the Replicated CLI with an API token. For more information, see [(Optional) Set Environment Variables](/reference/replicated-cli-installing#env-var).

To install and run the latest Replicated CLI in Docker environments:

1. Generate a service account or user API token in the vendor portal. To create new releases, the token must have `Read/Write` access. See [Generating API Tokens](/vendor/replicated-api-tokens).

1. Get the latest Replicated CLI installation files from the [replicatedhq/replicated repository](https://github.com/replicatedhq/replicated/releases) on GitHub.

    Download and install the files. For simplicity, the usage in the next step is represented assuming that the CLI is downloaded and installed to the desktop.

1. Authorize the Replicated CLI:

     - Through a Docker container:

        ```shell
        docker run \
          -e REPLICATED_API_TOKEN=$TOKEN \
          replicated/vendor-cli --help
        ```
        Replace `TOKEN` with your API token.

     - On Windows:

        ```dos
        docker.exe run \
          -e REPLICATED_API_TOKEN=%TOKEN% \
          replicated/vendor-cli --help
        ```

        Replace `TOKEN` with your API token.

  For more information about the `docker run` command, see [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/) in the Docker documentation.
