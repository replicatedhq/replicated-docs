:::note
The `replicated login` command creates a token after you log in to your vendor account in a browser and saves it to a config file. Alteratively, if you do not have access to a browser, you can set the `REPLICATED_API_TOKEN` environment variable to authenticate. For more information, see [(Optional) Set Environment Variables](#env-var) below.
