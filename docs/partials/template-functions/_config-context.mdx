Template functions in the config context are available when rendering an application that includes the KOTS [Config](/reference/custom-resource-config) custom resource, which defines the KOTS Admin Console config screen. At execution time, template functions in the config context also can use the static context functions. For more information about configuring the Admin Console config screen, see [About the Configuration Screen](/vendor/config-screen-about).
