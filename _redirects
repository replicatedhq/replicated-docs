# For syntax, see https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/#syntax-for-the-redirects-file
#
# In a _redirects file, each redirect rule must be listed on
# a separate line, with the original path followed by the new
# path or URL. Any line beginning with # will be ignored as a
# comment.
#
# Example:
# /home              /
# /blog/my-post.php  /blog/my-post
# /news              /blog
# /cuties            https://www.petsofnetlify.com
