# Step 5: Create a KOTS-Enabled Customer

After promoting the release, create a customer with the KOTS entitlement so that you can install the release with KOTS.

To create a customer:

1. In the [Vendor Portal](https://vendor.replicated.com), click **Customers > Create customer**.

   The **Create a new customer** page opens:

1. For **Customer name**, enter a name for the customer. For example, `KOTS Customer`.

1. For **Channel**, select **Unstable**. This allows the customer to install releases promoted to the Unstable channel.

1. For **License type**, select Development.

1. For **License options**, verify that **KOTS Install Enabled** is enabled. This is the entitlement that allows the customer to install with KOTS.

1. Click **Save Changes**.

1. On the **Manage customer** page for the customer, click **Download license**. You will use the license file to install with KOTS.
